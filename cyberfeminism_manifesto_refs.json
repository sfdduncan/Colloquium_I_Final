Above all, it is a book about the invention and reinvention of nature—perhaps the most central arena of hope, oppression, and contestation for inhabitants of the planet earth in our times. Once upon a time, in the 1970s, […] she belonged to those odd categories [US socialist-feminist, white, female, hominid biologist], invisible to themselves, which are called “unmarked” and which are dependent upon unequal power for their maintenance. But by the last essays, she has turned into a multiply marked cyborg feminist,(x)who tried to keep her politic, as well as her other critical functions, alive in the unpromising times of the last quarter of the twentieth century. […] Then, adopting an illegitimate and frightening sign, the book’s tale turns to the possibilities of a “cyborg” feminism that is perhaps more able to remain attuned to specific historical and political positionings and permanent partialities without abandoning the search for potent connections.",

The first concern relates to the idea that computers may be taught to simulate human thought, and the second relates to the possibility that automated robots may be wired to replace humans in the workplace. […] Artificial intelligence,(x)of course, threatens to reproduce the thinking subject, while the robot could conceivably be mass produced to form an automated workforce(x)(robot in Czech means “worker”).

The alt. hierarchy was created by John Gilmore and Brian Reid in 1987 in response to a reorganization of Usenet that would eventuate in greater censorship(424)of topics. “Alt” referred to topics that were “alternative”; that is, not part of mainstream popular culture.

The first […] is the story of a computer programmer […] who is turning herself into an android.(244)Then there is a series of unashamed infodumps (Thomas’s own term) which mix digressive commentaries or quotations into the text, and the chipper exhortations of a guide to a computer-generated role-playing game. And finally there is the story of the deepening friendship of Shirley and Rosa, which it slowly becomes clear is the role-playing game, a system of emotion therapy(466)written by the would-be android that slowly but surely takes over the book.

The ride is a descent into territories long considered taboo. One reviewer has likened da Rimini’s work to “confrontational rants,”(x)but there are also manifestations of a deep romanticism—“come dress yourself in love, let the journey begin,” she cajoles, “search for beauty without features, something deeper than any signs.” And once lulled, almost unsuspecting, you arrive at an image of naked figures kneeling before ominous black-suited men—full-screen, apocalyptic. da Rimini is uncompromising and condemns without distinction—“all history is pornography,” “wars are made by men who fuck their daughters.”",

Since this was before the Web's emergence, we used Director to design the ParkBench interface, which guides users to community and cultural information, and was the first such graphical interface for New York.

So strong, indeed, is the sense of convivial common ground invested in the living room that a cruel mind could hardly imagine a better place in which to stage a violation of LambdaMOO’s communal spirit. And there was cruelty enough lurking in the appearance Mr. Bungle presented to the virtual world—he was at the time a fat, oleaginous, Bisquick-faced clown dressed in cum-stained harlequin garb and girdled with a mistletoe-and-hemlock belt whose buckle bore the quaint inscription “KISS ME UNDER THIS, BITCH!” But whether cruelty motivated his choice of crime scene is not among the established facts of the case.

This is especially perplexing in light of the fact that African Americans, in a very real sense, are the descendants of alien abductees; they inhabit a sci-fi nightmare in which unseen but no less impassable force fields of intolerance frustrate their movements; official histories undo what has been done; and technology is too often brought to bear on black bodies (branding, forced sterilization, the Tuskegee experiment, and tasers come readily to mind).

    "excerpt": "The cyborg image can be read in two ways: as a coupling between a human being and an electronic mechanical apparatus, or as the identity of organisms embedded in a cybernetic information system. In the first sense, the coupling between human and machine is located within the body itself—the boundary between the material body and the artificial machine is surgically redrawn. In the second sense, however, the boundary between the body and technology is socially inscribed,(x)at once indistinct and arbitrary, but no less functional. A cyborg body, as Gregory Bateson might argue, “is not bounded by the skin but includes all external pathways along which information can travel.” […] Cyborg bodies are definitionally transgressive of a dominant culture order, not so much because of their “constructed” nature, but rather because of the indeterminacy of their hybrid design.",

They also have the capability to send images back through the internet to the web page.(x)The color video camera in the left eye records exactly what is in front of the doll. By looking at the world through the eyes of Tillie, viewers become not only voyeurs but also virtual cyborgs, because they use her eyes as a vehicle for their own remote and extended vision.

Before computerized information management, the heart of institutional command and control was easy to locate.

Castles, palaces, government bureaucracies, corporate home offices, and other architectural structures stood looming in city centers, daring malcontents and underground forces to challenge their fortifications. These structures, bespeaking an impregnable and everlasting solidity, could stop or demoralize contestational movements before they started.

Following this logic, phone sex is either “bad” (because it’s lazy, less than real, impoverished, greedy, self-indulgent, excessive) or else, phone sex is “good” (providing, as it can, “substitute activity” for those who cannot manage “real sex” due to illness).

It’s characterized, as [Sherry] Turkle puts it, by “the precedence of surface over depth, of simulation over the real, of play over seriousness.” For philosophers who have lamented the lack of objects to represent the postmodern condition, computing now offers the information of the Internet and the connections of the World Wide Web; the windows, icons, and layers of personal computing; the creatures in a SimLife(x)game; the simulations of the quantum world routinely used in introductory physics courses.",

Femina, bills itself as the first Web directory(x)for issues concerning women and girls, and if its catalogue of women writing on the web develops from what is currently more of a “women’s writing” list, then it could greatly assist in making the kinds of connections listed above. Another item of interest, and associated with Femina, is Webgrrls(x)which serves as a networking organization where women interested in the new media of the web get together for face-to-face meetings in local chapters across the United States. My own concern for these sorts of “directory” sites surrounds the possibility of losing exactly the types of connections that are unique to the Web.

Created on the World Wide Web as a “colony” in cyberspace, the Homestead (http://omnibus-eye.rtvf.nwu.edu/Homestead/) explores the effects of historical colonization on the technological present and the colonizing effects of technology. “Colonization”(227)is deliberately used here as a provocative term, in opposition to “technotopia”—the idealized vision of technology offered by centers of economic and political power. Colonization implies borders, an “us” and a “them,” a degree of violence. Identity is constructed on colony borders. On the border, objects and persons acquire names, differences are constructed. Only a fraction of the world’s people have a presence in cyberspace: the rest are outsiders. Will the outsiders eventually participate? Will borders and differences persist in cyberspace?",

Las propuestas de Beijing, por su actualidad y trascendencia sobre la temática están también presentes. Por último, se realiza un breve recorrido por las formas de apropiación de los contenidos de los medios, realizadas por las mujeres en países subdesarrollados.” —Martha Burkle Bonecchi, abstract",

Just as baby boomers were the first generation to grow up with television as a primary influence, Generation X (a term often used to describe the current population of twentysomethings) will undoubtedly feel the effects of the Internet for a long time to come. Much has been written already about the uniqueness of the “space” that only can be accessed online. It is interesting, however, to consider exactly what this new expanse—neither real nor tangible—means for specific groups: women, men of color, lower-class people, rural  people, the elderly, artists, writers, and so forth. Men, it has been estimated, account for 77 percent of the Internet’s total usage. This means that at any given moment, three men are online for every woman. At the same time, cyberspace is a forum that has, theoretically, more than enough room for everyone.(389)",

Initiated after a series of discussions that took place on the margins of European media arts and media culture events, via email, and in the dimly lit corners of bars begged the question “Where are the women?”(x)This constant question, and the desire to find out what women were doing with new media defined a gap in the existing structures and networks. Parallel to these discussions, the Face Settings project began to create informal settings that invited women to come to the table for a good meal and to discuss their work. It was the start to what would become an international network of women in media: artists, programmers, theorists, designers, curators, activists & djs, along with an assortment of other digital workers.",

Technology has always had profound effects on culture, on language and on ideology; technological innovation not only introduces new words, concepts and patterns into our culture, but radically alters old terminologies and undermines traditional ideologies. In creating these female cyborg subjects, [William] Gibson, [Pat] Cadigan, and [Terry] Mixon have begun to imagine the impact of technology upon human consciousness. In creating female-gendered cyborgs with male-gendered attributes, Gibson and Cadigan begin to depict “post-gender” beings. However, in their creation of such beings, they are still dependent upon the recognition of traditionally male and female gender characteristics. It is only in Mixon’s depiction of the cyborg character as both human and machine that we find a cyborg which begins to transcend gender by creating multiple split subjects.",

In particular, Stone’s work helps explain the predominance of themes of gender and sexual performativity or cross-identification in these narratives about cyberspace. I have written elsewhere about the relevance of theories of performativity to narratives of cyborg embodiment, but this essay considers the relevance of those theories to virtual reality computer interfaces and computer simulations, which tend to be represented popularly as technologies of disembodiment. To what extent do theories and practices of subversive mimicry and performativity, such as drag or butch-femme, function as a cultural framework for constructing the meaning of virtual reality and telepresence technologies?",

I was in the habit of tearing off the corners of pages as I read and chewing them into pulp. I became quite a connoisseur of the different flavors and textures. You could truthfully call me a voracious reader. […] Though labeled a vandal and a hooligan by librarians, I have always felt the warmest affection for books. Why else would I want to ingest them? Later on I read a description of this malady, considered a nervous ailment. I was lumped in with eaters of mud and sand, which seems to me quite another thing, though not without appeal. There is a good word for it: pica, which also, appropriately enough in my case, is a unit of size used in measuring type. (Spelled pika, it’s a little rodent.) I did not consider myself to be suffering a nervous ailment, of course. I liked the taste of books. New white paper, pulpy yellowing paper (dissolves), glossy coated paper that squeaked between the teeth, whose sharp triangular edges needed to be cautiously bitten blunt, I liked it, and also liked the cud I chewed it into, and considered it as good as gum, though lacking in flavor.",

    "excerpt": "Cybergrrlish lines of flight are important as vectors of investigation, research, invention, and affirmation. But these can t replace the hard work that is needed to identify and change the gendered structures, content, and effects of the new technologies on women worldwide. If it is true, as Sadie Plant argues that “women have not merely had a minor part to play in the emergence of the digital machines … [that] women have been the simulators, assemblers, and programmers of the digital machines,” then why are there so few women in visible positions of leadership in the electronic world? Why are women a tiny percentage of computer programmers, software designers, systems analysts, and hackers, while they are the majority of teletypers, chip-assemblers and installers, and lowskilled tele-operators that keep the global data and infobanks operating? Why is the popular perception still that women are technophobic? Sadly, the lesson of Ada Lovelace is that even though women have made major contributions to the invention of computers and computer programming, this hasn’t changed the perception—or reality—of women’s condition in the new technologies. Being bad grrls on the Internet is not by itself going to challenge the status quo, though it may provide refreshing moments of iconoclastic delirium.

From the opening image of morphing gender signifiers, Cheang propels the viewer into a probing investigation of human sexuality. It is an inquiry that utilizes hyperlinked images of a disembodied human form, once-live chat rooms on the subject of crime and punishment, and graphic moving images in order to illuminate the wide-reaching effect of Brandon’s life and death. Exploiting the highly mutable “skin” of the Internet,(45)Cheang reveals how this emerging virtual environment enables individuals to inhabit and play with different gender roles and characters.

The DNA Sluts are imaged as sort of pumped-up barbie dolls (“muscular hybrids”) with great laser beams shooting from their genital area.

At the same time, cyberfeminism has only taken its first steps in contesting technologically complex territories, […] overcoded to a mythic degree as a male domain. Consequently, cyberfeminist incursion into various technoworlds (CD-ROM production, Web works, lists and news groups, artificial intelligence, etc.) has been largely nomadic, spontaneous, and anarchic. On the one hand, these qualities have allowed maximum freedom for […] the beginnings of various written and artistic genres. On the other, […] theoretical issues of gender regarding the techno-social are immature relative to their development in spaces of greater gender equity won through struggle. Given such conditions, some feminist strategies and tactics will repeat themselves as women attempt to establish a foothold in a territory traditionally denied to them. […] Cyberspace is a crucial point of gender struggle that is desperately in need of gender diversification (and diversity in general).",

The question was whether observed race differences in access and use can be accounted for by differences in income and education, how access impacts use, and when race matters in the calculation of equal access. Whites are more likely than African Americans to have a computer in their homes (44.2% compared to 29.0%), but African Americans are more likely to state that they would like to acquire access to a computer. Whites are more likely to have used the Web (26% versus 22%). Increasing levels of household income corresponding to increased likelihood of owning a home computer, regardless of race. Increasing levels of education correspond to an increased likelihood of work computer access, regardless of race. People who owned a home computer and had access to a work computer were much more likely than others to have used the World Wide Web in the past 6 months. When students are considered, race almost always makes a difference. White students lacking a home computer, but not African American students, appear to find an alternative means of accessing the Internet. These results have certain implications for policy with regard to computer access. African American students need multiple points of computer access. To ensure the participation of African Americans in the information revolution, it is critical to improve the educational opportunities of African Americans. Results also indicate that if access is ensured, use will follow.” —Donna Hoffman and Thomas Novack, excerpt",

[…] Sadie Plant, a British writer based at Warwick University, has gained recognition as one of the best-known theorists of cyberfeminism particularly through her recent monographZeros + Ones: Digital Women + The New Technoculture(1997). Cyberfeminism, as defined by Plant, is an insurrection on the part of the goods and materials of the patriarchal world, a dispersed, distributed emergence composed of links between women, women and computers, computers and communication links,connections and connectionist nets. The key function of clitoris and the mission of disrupting the symbolic order from within (from masculine design and network solutions) is typified by the female artists’ group VNS Matrix’sCyberfeminist Manifesto for the 21st centuryand by their later work, which are for Plant both signs and proof of cyberfeminism overtaking the Net.",

This is a spatial change integrally connected to the senses, to women and to women’s discourse. As a part of this, she sees narrative form—since it is constructed, it is inherently “technological”—undergoing an evolution and, “if,” she says, “there is a term for fiction, it surely has yet to be invented.” Women have always been at the forefront of the development of fictional forms and now they are combining those forms with hypertext and with a wide variety of political discourses in radical ways.",

In 2002, while she was a doctoral candidate at New York University, Nelson edited a special issue of the cultural studies journal Social Text with a focus on Afrofuturism. The Afrofuturism issue—which addressed “the intersection between African diasporic culture and technology through literature, poetry, science fiction and speculative fiction, music, visual art, and the Internet,” and which maintained that “racial identity fundamentally influences technocultural practices”—turned out to be a seminal issue in the academic investigation of Afrofuturism. It also laid the foundation for Nelson’s work in producing critical interventions into Blackness and technology. Afrofuturism’s tentacular reach two decades later extends the prescience of the listserv and that collection of early texts on the subject beyond the academy and into the arts, community, and cultural institutions.",

Hypertext enables us to move beyond some of the perpetual debates of feminism in the last two decades and promotes a materialist synthesis of the best features of different feminist theoretical positions. Feminist hypertexts make clear the shortsightedness of polarized perspectives within feminism, from the essentialism vs. antifoundationalism debates to the arguments about whether political action should be focused at the level of the signifier or at the level of the system. Hypertext allows us to move beyond this binaristic thinking. The subjective, situated, experiential, and emotional nature of research is highlighted in feminist hypertexts. At the same time, the political, economic, and institutional nature of sexism and other oppressions is exposed and critiqued. Multiple voices and perspectives in the hypertexts demonstrate powerfully the contradiction of living under the regime of contemporary capitalism.

The essence of hypertext is that it does what we cannot do in books, what we cannot do on the page. We cannot speak about it, for hypertext’s function—the dynamic link—is wonderfully “unspeakable.” The reason for this creation of a multi-linear form is threefold: it mimics the associational nature of thought or a polyvocalic space; it enacts simultaneous conversation; and it is comprised of embodied spaces that exist concurrently in time. Through the reader’s act of choosing what a hypertext is and will become, hypertext becomes “embodied” by what are otherwise invisible choices in reading. […] Interactivity is not, however, the same thing as agency. Janet Murray argues that agency is born, not of interactivity as such, but through the act of spatial navigation within a text or an environment. In interactive environments, we construct the text as we read with our choices forming the contours of the space of our reading. A form of criticism that embodies agency as a native mode is essential to exploring feminist issues in women’s art.",

The first day began with short introductions and overviews referring to the history and current positions of Cyberfeminism, and the second day was devoted to the subject of “Women Hackers.” Both hacking itself and the paucity of women hackers were the star-ting points for the discussion. We focused on hacking as a way of life, an attitude, a metaphor about subverting the assets of the information age, and hacking, a myth generated and performed by men for men. We looked at the actual practice of hacking and discussed how cyberfeminists can test and appropriate this practice for their purposes.",

It is a space where “power becomes imaginary” since “in simcult the essential is nothing and nothing is essential,” and “the death of the political” finally comes about.

The body itself is invisible, it is immanent. We recognize it gradually by its development—the way it has presented itself is the way it is going to be. As a container of opportunities it is rooted in sexuality. In a different place, on the other hand, not in the body but in the culture (bodily culture and the culture of the epoch and the society) there lies an inventory of one’s possible stereotypes—whether images or bodily dynamics (informations). Information is not a structure, not identity, not a gender—it is a catalogue of possible expressions. Our goal is to keep the distance between the body as opportunity and the body as representation. Only then we have freedom to choose either a subject matter or a symbol or an image for self-identification to meet the conditions as well as requirements of the moment.",

A fundamental one is how to capitalize on our training in hospitality making it more possible within property relations, instead of forgetting our ways and jealously safeguarding our new belongings. What are the fortifications we are erecting in our cyberfeminist practices/spaces today? While an extensive survey of the history of cyberfeminist communities would be useful here, this is well beyond the scope of this short essay. Here, after some brief observations on the development of net communities in Russia with a view to showing its complicities with the construction of the Russian nation as a homogeneous entity, it is argued that the cyberfeminist articulations in Russia are in serious danger of replicating this very same homogenizations. However, it is also suggested that because of its own marginality within the Russian polity, cyberfeminism presents greater possibilities for evolving strategies of hosting the “other” through its net communities.",

    "excerpt": "My mission is to create a text which captures the knowledge I have acquired. This mission is incidental to the task I set out for myself some years ago: to carve a space for the “personal” in the discourse about and by Iranian women on the gender struggles in Iran prior to, during and after the 1979 Revolution. This had to be a space where the voice could be heard in the intimacy of the “private” addressing issues that are “public” because they affect the conditions of our lives. I have approached this task as an artist, and I wish my work to be viewed as art because I have no expertise in the social sciences and, as a practitioner with a particular past, I am distrustful of the paradigms of and boundaries around knowledge, its acquisition and its language in the Western, still male-dominated academic environment. By default, I find myself in the “margins”, still the space for the post-colonial and the feminist. But my relations to these two are ambivalent, for I am also critical of both for their exclusivist histories and representational practices that, in their own time, have suppressed, or at best ignored, the voices of the Other to the Other. […] Although feminist reconstructions of history place women and their activism on the main stage of the revolutionary movements in Iran, the revolutionary movements in Iran, defined and led by men, have consistently relegated women to the shadows, behind the curtains.",

Such questions suggest that the charged fantasies that become culture and ideology derive their charge in part from a complex relation to the body. The merely apparent virtuality of gender fantasy engages irresistably the material body—whether understanding it as something to escape, something from which fantastic scenarios derive, or that on which fantasies inscribe themselves And yet the establishment of a sex/gender distinction has elided the question of embodiment’s relation to gender. […] Critics of cyberculture have already been most engaged in considering the body’s relation to gender: for them understanding cyberculture has meant debating the place of the body in a virtual realm, and articulating that place has meant confronting questions of gender. As a “wonderful plot device,” virtual reality encourages experimental narratives of a subjectivity that exceeds the limitations of embodiment.",

One of the most basic reasons for this is that the binary opposition between cyberspace and “the real world” is not nearly as sharp or clean as it’s often made out to be. While the mediated nature of cyberspace renders invisible many (and, in some instances, all) of the visual and aural cues that serve to mark people’s identities IRL, that invisibility doesn’t carry back over into “the real world” in ways that allow people to log in and simply shrug off a lifetime of experiencing the world from specific identity-related perspectives. You may be able to go online and not have anyone know your race or gender—you may even be able to take cyberspace’s potential for anonymity a step further and masquerade as a race or gender that doesn’t reflect the real, offline you—but neither the invisibility nor the mutability of online identity makes it possible for you to escape your “real world” identity completely. Consequently, race matters in cyberspace precisely because all of us who spend time online are already shaped by the ways in which race matters offline, and we can’t help but bring our own knowledge, experiences, and values with us when we log on.",

The I.K.U. characters have names, identities, and missions, but I don’t think the story is the point, however carefully calibrated it may be. Narrative, which once was the weak spot in Cheang’s work, has become its strength. Or, rather, it is the very absence of narrative that has now supercharged her work, suffusing its every choice. Cheang’s mix of sensation and suggestion is perfectly suited to the post-hypertext world of post-verbal storytelling. What’s most intriguing about I.K.U. is its daring disposal of older forms and its unabashed effort to pioneer a visual text in which pornography and science fiction, film and video and computer, matinee and late-night, gallery and porn arcade, all merge into a single movie experience.",

For when we limit discussions about technology simply to computer hardware and software, we see only a “digital divide” that leaves people of color behind.

Focusing on the black diaspora, we broaden the category of “information technology” to show how traditions of coding and computation from indigenous African practices and black appropriations of Euro-American technologies have supported, resisted, and fused with the cybernetic histories of the West: a potential source for changes in reconstructing identity, social position and access to power in communities of the black diaspora.",

I think of them because I have been visiting places where the hardware of the digital revolution is assembled, and the people are not a part of this culture, and the conditions that they work and live in form the underside of the post-human. If we are to comprehend how identity and subjectivity are being reshaped in the digital age, we must look at the relationship between the desire to enable minds to fantasmatically disengage from bodies and the actuality of technologies that objectify bodies and bodily activity, thus disengaging them from minds. Digital disembodiment's fiction of transcendence relies on the expulsion of the abject inter-relations between bodies and technologies from the virtual imaginary.",

As a two-way street, this would allow us to avoid “subaltern”/”enlightening” opposition and attitude which is still pertinent within feminist and cyberfeminist networks, when “inferior” or “fixed” consciousness is assumed on the part of “global” partners whenever they encounter different frames of reference from their own. At the same time, claiming “subaltern” or “otherness” status on the part of “local” (cyber)feminist communities in relation to the West often obscures power relations within local contexts, which interests me most.",

These very personal stories offer insight into lived experience where gender intersects with class, ethnicity, nationality, sexuality, generation, and subcultural identity in shaping technological encounters.Cyborg Lives?uses Donna Haraway's now well-known cyborg metaphor to examine the centrality of technology to daily life. The result is a series of fascinating life-stories that stimulate thinking about the ways that technology intersects with ordinary, everyday experieces. The volume asserts that, in the twenty-first century, technology is an intrinsic part of our subjectivity—whether we like it or not.Cyborg Lives?is written in an accessible way, while at the same time reflecting a range of sophisticated theoretical perspectives.

Women’s cyberfiction, however, combines feminist science fiction’s examination of gender and gendered relations with cyberpunk’s exploration of what it means to live in a technoculture. Like much cyberpunk, women’s cyberfiction portrays a dystopic future—a world of extreme economic extremes and class antagonism, pervasive violence, and environmental disaster ruled by multinational corporations via global information and communication networks. Pleasure within this culture can increasingly be found only through virtual-reality technologies […] Women’s cyberfiction documents how women and other marginalized groups can maneuver for survival within this technodystopia. In this fiction there is no “outside” position from which to critique technology, just as there is no “outside” position from which to critique gender.

[…] In a society in which data security and the stability of the infrastructure have become major concerns, the hacker is being hyped as the perfect concept of an enemy. Hackers do not just function as a screen on which technophobia is projected, but also serve, very concretely, as an excuse to cut the rights of the netizens (see cybercrime convention etc.) But the subversive activity of hackers is not exclusively reserved for the criminal-minded, as the media would lead us to believe. In many cases the goals are not about acquisition but about emancipation: to maintain freedom (e.g., from censorship), security (e.g., through cryptography) and to flatten hierarchies like software monopoly (e.g., the free software movement).",

    "excerpt": "Cyberfeminism becomes often articulated against “feminism” which signifies the “second wave” of the 1970s, and is understood as homogenizing, essentializing, and anti-technology. Accusing feminism of reductionism, cyberfeminist articulations postulate the ‘second wave’ feminism as a version of gynocentrism and cultural-feminism where women and nature are allies against the masculinist culture of technology and control. As Faith Wilding has noted, cyberfeminists tend to depict 1970s feminism as monumental, essentialist, anti-technology as well as anti-sex, while there may be little understanding of the history of feminist theory and practice. And, paradoxically, “cyberfeminism has already adopted many of the strategies of avant-garde feminist movements,” such as separatism and women-only groups. […] Certainly there has never been such a thing as “a feminist definition of technology,” but rather multiple feminist takes on and critiques of different technologies, as well as attempts to appropriate them and alter their meanings.",

    "excerpt": "Among feminists it is often assumed that no feminist can be racist because of her awareness of gender oppression. Yet, still today, racist attitudes prevent women from establishing politically and personally enriching connections. Among cyberfeminists, belief in the myth of “equality” in the equally mythical realm of cyberspace is widespread. […] Because the hierarchies of RL (Real Life) are believed to be inapplicable to cyberspace, discussions of race have only recently been initiated in electronic media theory and criticism. In an influential 1999 publication, Beth Kolko, Lisa Nakamura, and Gilbert B. Rodman observe that in academic electronic mailing list participants studiously avoid and actively silence discussions of race. Kolko et al. argue “outing race” would render more accurately the diversity of cyberspace but they do not specify how making race visible might change existing power relations. In their words: “Cyberspace has been construed as some thing that exists in binary opposition to ‘the real world,’” but when it comes to questions of power, politics and structural relations, cyberspace is as real as it gets.",

It is a space where the diasporic stories of the past (often told as if they were stories from the present)and of places left behind can reach the actual physical (socio-cultural in flux)places that are fetishized in the memory/nostalgia of the model native(diasporic) informants. The real places, however, are not the same (obviously) as in the memory of the diasporic storyteller. In cyborg-diaspora, those who have left home have taken on the role of native informant. They speak and thus silence narratives from “back home” within a powerfield that celebrates the “Westernized” as “progressive” and degrades the “third world” as “under-developed.” Unused to having their narratives challenged in shared public spaces, the cyborg-diaspora potentially faces the ‘real’ in the form of counternarratives from those “back home.”",

It is notable that in a legal context, whereas there has been much attention paid to technical issues that cyberspace poses, there has been little attention paid to these new issues above, or possible theoretical frameworks within which to contextualize them, or potential feminist perspectives. Put simply, the debates of cyberstudies, and cyberfeminism in particular, have as yet been largely unreflected in mainstream academic and practical legal discourse. The aim of this essay, then, is to begin a process of integration. By looking at the work of some cyberfeminists, the author attempts to give a clearer picture of key debates and strands of thought in cyberfeminism, and to start thinking about how cyberfeminist insights might be used as part of a useful theoretical framework that could inform those academics interested in law, queer issues, and cyberspace.",

The discovery of subtle subject/object reversals in these encounters, and the recognition of moving between participant and observer roles, strike me as potentially creative features of what Sean Cubitt calls “post-privacy culture.” Because there are real people interacting here, caught up in the ambiguity of distance and intimacy characteristic of on-line display exchanges, this is a zone that can help us appreciate how the integration of computer technology into so many facets of our communications is changing social relations. If contemporary culture is indeed becoming increasingly characterized by post-privacy, artificiality, and cybernetic human–machine interaction, it seems important to understand and nurture relational qualities like empathy that can apply to both familiar and new forms of exchange.",

Everywhere we turn these days there is a celebration of women using the Internet or some other computer related technology. But what are we allowed to use these technologies for and within which contexts? Why are we allowed? Who are the women allowed? Under what conditions are we allowed? Why are we under a constant state of ‘being allowed’? Where and how can we locate women’s agency in relation to these spaces and practices? At the same time as there is this mediated visibility of “gender” in relation to computers and cyberspace, much discourse surrounding “new” technologies implicitly assumes the transparency of these technologies. Therefore, even as women are displayed visibly in relation to various technological contexts, the complex gendered, raced, classed, embodied—in short the socio-cultural and economically situated—nature of technological design and practices are not acknowledged often enough.",

As Nancy Stepan claims, “A theory of metaphor is as critical to science as it is to the humanities.” The paper, therefore, is concerned with the identity politics of post-industrial feminism(s) implicit in what I'd like to call a modem of one's own, a cyber-driven metaphor which is intended to evoke the discursive inter-relations between embodiment, technology, science and signifying practices while keeping in mind the pervasive influence of Woolf’s text in feminist theory. To this end, I will examine the epistemological and ontological differences between the subject of Woolf’s “room” and the figure of Donna Haraway’s cyborg as reflecting a perceptual shift in feminism traceable in strategies of interpretation.",

Despite theoretical gestures that have been critiqued as essentializing and colonizing, several French feminists recognized and sought to affirm the connections between materiality and cognition through a celebration of embodied writing; hypertext theorists rarely acknowledge the connections among bodies, gender and writing and seek instead to disembody the writing process, reifying instead the “mind,” and a philosophical history that glorifies masculine cognition.",

Aside from the utilization of the internet or the appropriation of cyberculture and cyberspace, it is less clear whether or not a feminist, or a woman, addressing women’s topics and working with technology, multimedia or digital art, is cyberfeminist. This lack of clarity also applies to work not accessible in cyberspace or that doesn’t depend on the internet. For example, it is unclear whether video and art transmitted on the net are really interactive, and/or whether they can be identified as “internet art” (not necessarily netart) as opposed to “net.art.” If the definition of cyberfeminism seems ambiguous, identifying cyberfeminist art is even more so, and accomplishing such a definition is further complicated when we center on the Latin American region, where very few artists are willing to pay the stigma of being feminist.",

This chapter is concerned with the earthquake effects of the Cyborg Manifesto in academia and cyberculture more generally. I cannot claim any overarching objectivity: I was a student of Haraway’s during the 1980s, and have been familiar with the essay from its pre-history to its breakthrough with the notion of the cyborg, following its career through various published, republished, and re-edited versions, not to mention spin-off interviews and elaborations.

Instead of encouraging reflection on these issues, many cyberfeminists suppress it. In the rare cyberfeminist considerations of racism, there seems to be a confusion between racism as a social problem, and an individual’s voluntary identification with a specific group. Those wishing to discuss racism are accused of essentialism and derided for their ignorance of recent theoretical and scientific developments. The centuries-old realization (by those at the receiving end) that race is a construction is touted as a newly discovered truth. Because “race does not exist” racism is cast as an imaginary problem in the mind of naive, retrogressive individuals. Simultaneously, the image of “the Third World Woman” as poorly educated, bound by repressive cultural traditions and by the body, living and thinking in a time anterior to their first world counterparts prevails.

In 1995, only 15 percent of Internet users were women, but by early 2000, women comprised 50 percent of users (a 32 percent increase since 1999). Yet patriarchy has never been absent. Men controlled the content, men earned the profit. Similarly, a gender gap emerged in how women and men accessed the Internet: men surfed, hopping from site to site; women went directly to certain sites or searched for information on specific topics. Making the Internet more women-friendly required easing the process of associating women with each other and the information they sought. Once “arrived,” they’d connect with women’s organizations, announcements, and resources, as well as with each other. Linking sites through hyperlinks (plus web rings, list serves, etc.) has become the ultimate in virtual sisterhood: we can steer one another to like-minded sites and organizations in order to better educate ourselves. The nature of the Internet makes being on-line a natural for women: expressing ourselves through words—as we do now in e-mail, list serves, or websites—is an extension of our own tendencies to communicate.",

In the convergence between biology and computer science, it is the biology which speaks more loudly, and seems to speak more clearly to thefeminist. From a distance, Artificial Life certainly looks like “sociobiology in computational clothing” and Alison Adam was right to point out the dangers of a discourse which subsumes cultural into biological explanations of life. But the challenge for cyberfeminism—which, like other aspects of feminism, has had to interrogate its own relation to biological discourse through the problems of universalism and essentialism—is to recognise the plurality of positions which simultaneously undermine and strengthen not just its own case but that of its supposed adversary. There is no “biology” any more than there is a homogenous “feminism.”",

    "excerpt": "In [Anthony Walton’s] discussion of technology versus African-Americans, he ignores the technological innovations created by the latter, Africans, and the rest of the world. This leads the reader to assume that no black (without Western tutelage) has played a role in the history of technology except as victim or passive recipient. The first alphabets; the concept of zero; gynecology; veterinary medicine; the 365 day calendar (anticipating its “discovery” in the west by three thousand years); elements of geometry; Cesarean section; iron and copper smelting—all of these and far more were accomplished outside the West; indeed, before the West had developed from roaming tribes into permanent organized settlements. This is not to claim, therefore, that African civilizations are obviously superior: Only that the rather large and influential advancements they provided have been denied and usurped by late nineteenth and early twentieth century historians such as Arnold Toynbee, who famously declared that, outside of Europe, no other continent had contributed to world civilization. […] In our representation of the technological revolution, we construct the same mythological doctrine that still plagues public school and mass media representation of its American history by presenting it as almost wholly white and male.",

    "excerpt": "For women, the Internet has two faces: it has helped foster women’s ownership of business and their entrepreneurial efforts, but has also increased the availability of pornography, often accused as contributing to the continued societal oppression and exploitation of women. Recognizing that some women are directing their entrepreneurial efforts to cyberporn, the seeming antithesis of women’s equality and empowerment, this article considers the connection between and ramifications of these phenomena. Using a sample of 71 cyberporn sites, the gender of owners, operators, and performers was studied. Next, 37% of the female owners were interviewed regarding their motivations for operating cyberporn sites. Results demonstrate that women constitute a significant portion of cyberporn operators and are emigrating from the sex industries to cyberporn. Furthermore, these actions are motivated by the concerns of the traditional working woman: salary, control of work environment, flexibility of schedule. This article, thus, suggests that far from being complicit in the oppression and exploitation of women, web mistresses may reflect a degree of emancipation from male-dominated female imagery and economic control.",

In doing so, they present an image of new technology as radically distinct from older technologies and, as such, positive for women. (6) In looking forward to what these new technologies may make possible, they elaborate a new feminist “imaginary” different from the “material reality” of the existing technological order. In this way, in common with other proponents of the impact of information and biotechnologies, they distinguish new technologies from more established ones, and downplay any continuities between them. While attributing a technological determinism to the past, paradoxically such approaches infer a new form of technological determinism, albeit one that predicts a future that advantages women over men. […] We shall see that if the social relations of older technologies are presented in too rigid a form, then the new technologies come to be seen as too open and malleable. If the former give rise to an immobilizing pessimism, the latter obviate the need for feminist technopolitics.",

As Faith Wilding characterizes it, “Linking the terms ‘cyber’ and ‘feminism’ creates a crucial new formation in the history of feminism(s) and of the e‐media. Each part of the term necessarily modifies the meaning of the other.” The significant year, in my view, was 1997, an amazingly productive year for women confronting their often contradictory positions of “working with new technologies and feminist politics.” That year saw the incredible confluence of women’s groundbreaking involvement in digital media technologies across theoretical, critical, and activist spheres of feminist influence. And despite technology’s gender gap and racialized digital divide rhetorics, black and white women's technophilia would not be denied.",

It is a solution-oriented form of political action that inserts bodies and media-based dissent into real time material concerns.

    "excerpt": "Cyberfeminist is situated in a crossroad of art, research and activism and the debates over the meaning of cyberfeminism have also to do with the varying backgrounds of individual cyberfeminist, as well as their respective understandings of feminism. According to the former VNS Matrix member Julianne Pierce, cyberfeminism is an “incredibly important ‘movement’ that is certainly ‘feminism,’ as it advocates that women participate in creating and defining the present and future of techno culture. But somehow the ‘feminism’ is the problem, some of the old guard see it as a vacuous fashion statement (a sort of cyberspice), and the young guard don’t need feminism anymore.” Pierce suggests abandoning the term, or updating it in a plural form to correspond to its many strands. In any case what is needed is a shift from utopian visions to considerations of power, money, and Internet business: “The new cyberfeminism is about confronting the top-down with the bottom-up [—] It’s about creating foundations to build upon, so that in the next millennium we can carve our own paths, create our own corporations.”",

InControl and Freedom, Wendy Hui Kyong Chun explores the current political and technological coupling of freedom with control by tracing the emergence of the Internet as a mass medium. The parallel (and paranoid) myths of the Internet as total freedom/total control,(x)she says, stem from our reduction of political problems into technological ones. She traces the desire for cyberspace to cyberpunk [page \"Razorgirls: Genre and Gender in Cyberpunk Fiction\" not found] fiction and maps the transformation of public/private into open/closed. Analyzing ‘pornocracy,’ [page \"Pornografia no consentida\" not found] she contends that it was through cyberporn and the government’s attempts to regulate it that the Internet became a marketplace of ideas and commodities.” —summary by the publisher MIT Press",

I photographed artists who fit the Cyborg Hybrid criteria and had them wear white t-shirts with beaded text such as “AUTHORITY ON ALL ABORIGINAL ISSUES,” “INDIAN GIVER” and other slogans that would illustrate common Aboriginal stereotypical text. I also created white chokers for them to wear while I photographed them in stoic poses, mocking photographs of Aboriginal people from the 19th and early 20th century. I then digitally alter the photos to look like they could fit within a glamorous magazine. Their defiant poses challenge the viewer to try and classify their identity.",

[…] My use of the term is intended to suggest how Internet spectators continue to be rendered and regulated by technologies and representations and to reference apparatus and feminist psycho-analytic film theory, feminist art history, and visual cultural studies.

STS studies stress that technologies are not fixed at the innovation stage but continue in their implementation and use. Different groups of people involved with a technology can have different understandings of that technology, and consumers or users can radically alter the meanings and deployments of technologies. So the same artifact means, and therefore largely is, different things to different women. For example, a young woman in the West experiences her silver cell phone as a liberating extension of her body. For her mother, it may primarily be a tool to keep track of her children. For women working as traders in Bangladesh, the mobile phone provides the means to run businesses selling communication services to other women. The point I want to emphasize here is that the social relations of production that underpin the mobile phone’s existence are opaque in all these cases.",

[…] By examining a range of new digital production practices by creators of minority popular visual cultures on the Internet, I have hoped to give a sense of how this group of users sees, rather than merely how they are seen or represented, what they are making as well as what they are using, what they are doing a well as what they are being. […] Yet still, that skin continues to digital articulate itself in its difference, perhaps for the first time in a public form that is as yet much less regulated than other media spaces for visual representation. In defiance of public discourse that says that race doesn’t exist and doesn’t matter, either scientifically or practically, users continue to make avatars, Web sites, quizzes, moving image sequences, and petitions that say it does, and it does.",

In which ways could a Nordic feminist perspective on digital media make a difference in relation to dominant research traditions? What would be particular and unique about Nordic cyberfeminism compared to the “unmarked” version of cyberfeminism dominating the field today? These are questions that the contributors to this book set out to address. This introductory chapter starts out with a partial history of cyberfeminism, leading to a call for alternative, empirically grounded cyberfeminist perspectives and projects that make explicit their own cultural premises. Secondly, the chapter maps out the specificities of a Nordic perspective, starting with a brief historical overview of linguistic contiguities and shared traits among the Nordic countries.

Oh yes; you may not have noticed, but many of us are US feminists. We are part of you. We live among you, and we have invisibly struggled by your side for decades.” Yet, American feminists were only interested in addressing “the veil and female genital mutilation as they speak of Arab women’s oppression.” Saliba traces the history of modern Arab-American feminism to 1981 when women of color challenged white feminists at the National Women’s Studies Association (NWSA) conference and emerged in a coalition of “US Third World Feminists.” Their experiences at the NWSA conferences motivated Arab-American women to take a more active role in expressing their voices in local, national, and international politics.",

Laboratory constructed human embryos, animals, plants and trans-species are proliferating in our environment. These are fleshed beings beyond any previously known category, transgressing boundaries in ways previously only imagined in myth and science fiction. An era of interspecies technologies introduces irrevocable changes in reproductive and generative processes, the raw materials of which are often (female) human and animal body parts. Many knowledge/power systems intersect and collide on this biotech frontier: from computing technologies, medicine, and genetics to religion, philosophy, and feminist theory. And yet there is very little public debate or critical analysis engaging the philosophical, ethical, and political issues of difference raised by the new bio sciences.

    "excerpt": "The information highway, situated as it is within hierarchies that privilege certain ways of being, cannot be of any use in providing information and empowering such groups of people unless those of us who claim to be invested in building diverse webs actually take the trouble to understand these offline realities and help provide options for these “Others” to not only gain access but also subvert and transform the gendered hierarchies that continue to govern digital spaces. Such background is necessary for those of us who claim to be “cyberfeminist” (whatever the level of comfort or discomfort with which we assume such a label) as we examine how “resistance” and “transformation” in online spaces is manifested and sometimes even (re)appropriated. […] The basis for any type of change is formed, we would argue, through location and positioning in relation to shifting centers and margins. One might then ask—what sorts of resistance and transformation emerges offline through the situated/located practices and negotiations of offline communities?",

    "excerpt": "The emergence of Internet networks of immigrants provides a complex counterpoint to such divergent understandings of technol-ogy-mediated communities. “Cyborg diaspora” as a term   was originally conceived by [Indira] Karamcheti (1992), much before the proliferation of the  Internet, to talk of a possible technology-enabled community that would help disrupt the fossilized notion of “Indianness” within Indian immigrant communities. This conception has been  actualized in many online communities created on the Internet by immigrants. [Radhika] Gajjala, another Indian scholar, rejuvenates Karamcheti’s cyborg diasporas to “refer to the formation of virtual imagined communities of diasporic post-colonials online.” The expressions of immigrants have been characterized by the conception of an “imagined community,” an extension of the boundaries of the nation-state and geocentric ethnicity created by the imagination of people separated by distance yet united by the twin forces of print media and capitalism.",

[…] Complementing E-leusis’s and Mujeres en Red’s orientation toward cyberfeminist praxis, other important portals such as Remedios Zafra's Habitar en punto(net) (2008) or Estudios online, created by Ana Martínez-Collado (2008), are dedicated to the phenomenon of cyberfeminism, particularly the version relating to art and technology. Cyberfeminist blogs bear mentioning, as well; in some cases, the creators of the Web portals maintain blogs, such as Montserrat Boix’s own, which she defines as a blog about feminisms, free knowledge, ethical technology and networks (Nireblog). Many other blogs on cyberfeminism are on the web pages of major cyberfeminist activists, as in those housed on Mujeres en Red. […] This “social cyberfeminism” would concern itself with debates about, and consequences of, constructing new identity online; further, it would explore approaches to feminist praxis departing from the inclusion of women in the (traditionally masculine) fields of programming, creation of networks, and even hacking.",

The definition is contestable, subjective and open to a range of interpretations, and the majority of interventions to combat it are mostly concerned with obscenity and child pornography. Sexual rights workers are troubled by the growing role of conservative forces—supported by religious extremists—and their attempts to encourage new legislation that would treat all online sexual exchanges as sexual predation and all adult content on the internet as pornography. This protectionist approach overshadows other important aspects of the internet that directly impact on internet users’ lives and their ability to access vital information on sexuality, sexual health and sexual rights.

    "excerpt": "Current debate on women in free/libre open source software (FLOSS) tends to fall into the gender stereotype of men and women when coming across to the gender issue. This article stays away from a reductionism that simplifies the gender issue in the FLOSS community to the level of a fight between men and women. Instead of splitting women from men in the FLOSS development, this analysis helps motivate both men and women to work together, reduce the gender gap and improve the disadvantaged statuses of women and a wider users’ community in the FLOSS development. More importantly, it addresses not only the inequality that women face in computing, but also other inequalities that other users face, mainly emerging from the power relationships between expert and lay person (namely, developer and user) in software design. In so doing, the issue at stake is not only to create a welcome environment for women to join the FLOSS development, but also to come up with a better way of encouraging both sexes to collaborate with each other. This article starts from how FLOSS can make a difference for today’s information society, and present some successful stories of implementing FLOSS in developing countries and rural areas to empower women and the minority. Consequently, it discusses the problem of including more women and the minority in the FLOSS development through deconstructing the myth of the programming skill.",

    "excerpt": "Cyberfeminism is neither a single theory nor a feminist movement with a clearly articulated political agenda. Rather, “cyberfeminism” refers to a range of theories, debates, and practices about the relationship between gender and digital culture, so it is perhaps more accurate to refer to the plural, “cyberfeminism(s).” Within and among cyberfeminism(s) there are a number of distinct theoretical and political stances in relation to Internet technology and gender as well as a noticeable ambivalence about a unified feminist political project. Further, some distinguish between the “old” cyberfeminism, characterized by a utopian vision of a postcorporeal woman corrupting patriarchy, and a “new” cyberfeminism, which is more about “confronting the top-down from the bottom-up.” Thus, any attempt to write about cyberfeminism as if it were a monolith inevitably results in a narrative that is inaccurately totalizing. However, what provides common ground among these variants of cyberfeminism(s) is the sustained focus on gender and digital technologies and on cyberfeminist practices.",

Drawing on case studies of nine digital diaspora organizations, Brinkerhoff's research supplies new empirical material regarding digital diasporas and their potential security and development impacts. She also explores their impact on identity negotiation, arguing that digital diasporas create communities and organizations that represent hybrid identities and encourage solidarity, identity, and material benefits among their members. The book also explores these communities’ implications for policy and practice.” —Summary by the publisher Cambridge University Press",

She challenges the problematic historical view of black people as quintessential information-age outsiders or poster children for the digital divide by uncovering their early technolust and repositioning them as eager technology adopters and consumers, and thus as co-constituent elements in the information technology revolution. She offers several case studies that include lessons learned from early adoption of the Internet by the Association of Nigerians Living Abroad and their Niajanet virtual community, the grassroots organizing efforts that led to the phenomenally successful Million Woman March, the migration of several historic black presses online, and an interventionist critique of race in contemporary video games.

The expanding engagement at the intersection of feminist scholarship and science and technology studies (STS) has enriched both fields immeasurably, and I will largely focus my reflections on the literature associated with these sites. I begin by highlighting the continuities as well as the differences between contemporary and earlier feminist debates on technology. Current approaches focus on the mutual shaping of gender and technology, in which technology is conceptualized as both a source and consequence of gender relations. In avoiding both technological determinism and gender essentialism, such theories emphasize that the gender-technology relationship is fluid and situated. These deliberations highlight how processes of technical change can influence gender power relations. A feminist politics of technology is thus key to achieving gender equality.",

Trading sex for codes, code sexes code, the defunct IKU coders infected with body/software virus emerge amidst noise blast to declare themselves UKI the virus. Meanwhile, GENOM Corp.’s BioNet aims to re-program human orgasm into “self-sustained pleasure,” a profitable bio-scheme conspired without any precaution for damaging the biosphere.

She does not define the term, which appears in her final sentence, but simply asserts that “A feminist technology should, indeed, be something else again.” […] The term “feminist technology” did not catch on though, and explanation for this might be found in the linked history of the term “feminist,” which has had a spotty presence in what is commonly, and tellingly, known as “gender and technology studies.” […] Once we agreed to make “feminist technolgies” a goal, we started with a series of definitional questions: Do any exist? If so, what makes a technology feminist? What criteria must a feminist technology fulfill?",

    "excerpt": "[Shulamith] Firestone saw technology as progressive and liberating unless improperly used, yet misleading inasmuch as hers was certainly a claim for feminist agency, social change, and political struggle. Her faith in the transformative potential of technology was conditional and based on women’s ability to gain control over it. In contrast, Sadie Plant has argued for the impossibility of female agency and seen the process of feminization as both automatic and spontaneous. Plant’s theory of feminization assumes an intimate affinity between women and increasingly complex technology, both of which have been instruments and tools for (male-dominated) culture. However, women and machines are growing out of control: “tools mutate into complex machines which began to learn and act for themselves […] As media, tools and goods mutate, so the women begin to change, escaping their isolation and becoming increasingly interlinked.” For Plant, feminization is a process parallel to the history of women’s liberation, but one foreclosing intentional agency: “Cybernetics is feminisation. When intelligent space emerges alongside the history of women’s liberation, no one is responsible. That’s the point, the fold in the map, where architects get lost in the pattern.Self-guiding systems were not in the plan.”",

Notably, what I termed the “breakdown-of-binary project” in order to explore the dialectic of the cyborg figure. […] Although the cyborg figure is deemed to be a hybrid, the term “cyborg” dangerously relocates this figure into an identity of “singularity.” […] The relational process of technology, inherently libratory and oppressive, is discussed via concepts of origin and the idea of “embodied choices.” […] Switch is the becoming cyborg dependent on the contextual conditions of emergence. […] This emergence of switch is a process-state only readable in reflection. Switch holds at the core of coming-to-be an agency that is enacted via the “how” or put differently, our approach to technology, to our becoming as cyborgs. In this mode of becoming our agency is switch. We are switch.",

This article focuses on one Iraqi woman’s life within value systems that privilege males, and discusses how she subverts, resists, and supports the male value systems while negotiating the influences of war, Western culture, and her life in a tightly controlled Islamic environment. I argue that “Riverbend” (a pseudonym), in her blog,Baghdad Burning, is singing songs of resistance at a digital well using a virtual veil in order to subvert the rigid laws of sexual seclusion that the current war generates. In this digital environment, Riverbend relies on her familiar cultural traditions (influenced by Islam) to create new strategies of resistance and to connect with other women as a cyberconduit. Relying on [Rosi] Braidotti’s (1994) concept of the nomadic subject and rhizome theory, I discuss the ways Riverbend uses her blog as the new meeting place, or well, using the soulful musical poetry of the Iraqi sihr halal—“lawful magic”—in themes that center around her private life, addressed to a public audience, with women guarding the information, passing on culture, and creating a new version of the magical words.",

    "excerpt": "In the early 1990s, cyberfeminism surfaced as an arena for critical analyses of the inter-connections of gender and new technology especially so in the context of the internet, which was then emerging as something of a “mass-medium.” Scholars, activists and artists interested in media technology and its gendered underpinnings formed networks and groups. Consequently, they attached altering sets of meaning to the term cyberfeminism that ranged in their take on, and identifications with feminism. Cyberfeminist activities began to fade in the early 2000s and the term has since been used by some as synonymous with feminist studies of new media yet much is also lost in such a conflation. This article investigates the histories of cyberfeminism from two interconnecting perspectives. First, it addresses the meanings of the prefix “cyber” in cyberfeminism. Second, it asks what kinds of critical and analytical positions cyberfeminist networks, events, projects and publications have entailed. Through these two perspectives, the article addresses the appeal and attraction of cyberfeminism and poses some tentative explanations for its appeal fading and for cyberfeminist activities being channeled into other networks and practiced under different names.",

The avatar is a technological artifact as is the apparel designed for it. Without the avatar, the sari on Second Life cannot exist. However, an avatar also exerts agency. The avatar forms an identity and takes on roles in the communities that it participates in. […] In the case of the weaver too, he is at a human-technology continuum in another way. The weaver’s function in relation to the loom and the loom’s function in producing handloom textiles are clearly intertwined. The human being must become the cyborg weaver if he is to produce a good product. Both visually, aesthetically and affectively the weaver is immersed and appears as one with the machine’. The two must function together within a whole community that creates value for the weaver’s product through continued marketing, consumption, and use in cultural rituals. This is the only way to produce handloom material or there is no handloom cloth inexistence at all. Any piece of cloth that is not produced from this intense exchange between weaver, loom, the community of consumers, the dyers and spinners etc, would not carry the label of handloom, obviously.",

It demonstrates how gender has played an unacknowledged role in the history of computing, shaping beliefs and practices on issues ranging from the nature of expertise to the organization of work to the purpose of computer science. Although this is primarily a historical work, I also highlight connections between the gendered practices of the past and policy issues of today. In what has become a much-discussed paradox, women’s numbers in computing have declined since the mid-1980s in the United States and United Kingdom, even as women’s participation in other areas of science and technology has risen. Computer scientist Tracy Camp sounded the alarm in 1997 that women were leaving computer science in disproportionate numbers at every stage of education and academic employment, a phenomenon she dubbed “the incredible shrinking pipeline.”",

We’re reaching girls around the world and are on track to close the gender gap in new entry-level tech jobs by 2030.

Glitch Feminism, however, embraces the causality of “error,” and turns the gloomy implication of glitch on its ear by acknowledging that an error in a social system that has already been disturbed by economic, racial, social, sexual, and cultural stratification and the imperialist wrecking-ball of globalization—processes that continue to enact violence on all bodies—may not, in fact, be an error at all, but rather a much-needed erratum. This glitch is a correction to the “machine”, and, in turn, a positive departure. […] We want to claim for ourselves permanent seats at the table, an empowered means of demarcating space that can be possessed by us in entirety, a veritable “room of [our] own” that, despite the strides made via feminist political action, has yet to truly belong to us.",

[…] The stories offered here are thought experiments that confront “Indianness” in a genre that emerged in the mid-nineteenth-century context of evolutionary theory and anthropology profoundly intertwined with colonial ideology, whose major interest was coming to grips with—or negating—the implications of these scientific mixes of “competition, adaptation, race, and destiny.” […] Writers of Indigenous futurisms sometimes intentionally experiment with, sometimes intentionally dislodge, sometimes merely accompany, but invariably change the perimeters of sf.",

If #gamergate supporters need to respect this diversity, many non-gamers also need to accept that the dichotomy between the physical (real) and the virtual (fake) is dated; in game spaces, individuals perform their identities in ways that are governed by the same social relations that are operative in a classroom or park, though with fewer inhibitions. That’s why—instead of either continuing on quests to kill more baddies or declaring the game a trivial, reactionary space where sexists thrive and abandoning it—I embarked on a quest to facilitate conversations about discriminatory language in WoW’s public discussion channels.",

[…] This is a record of physiological and political micromutations provoked in BP’s body by testosterone, as well as the theoretical and physical changes incited in that body by loss, desire, elation, failure, or renouncement. I’m not interested in my emotions insomuch as their being mine, belonging only, uniquely, to me. […] Some will read this text as a manual for a kind of gender bioterrorism on a molecular scale.

How is digital creativity affected by gender norms? ‘Digital Gender & Aesthetic Technology’ aims to make visible females as creative developers of the Internet and new technology, through interviews with students, artists, project managers, and entrepreneurs. The prevailing social norms appear to be reflected on the Internet as ‘digital gender norms,‘ where girls and boys prefer apparently different communication tools. While working with the question of ‘digital gender,’ I have developed the hypothesis of ‘Aesthetic Technology,’ namely that girls often have an artistic approach towards technology. Girls mainly learn technology for a personal reason, planning to create something once they have learned the technique, and their goal often have aesthetic preferences. The question of girls ‘becoming technical,’ is more complicated than one might first think, in relation to gender. Even though young girls are often just as interested in technology as young boys are, it is difficult for them to keep or adapt their technical interest to normative femininity in their teens. Another problem is that expressions of technical competence or innovation, which do not correspond to the predominant male norm, might be hard to recognize. Females who study within the field of creative digital technology often begin their career by struggling with questions of equality, instead of just practicing their profession.” —Sol Morén, abstract",

There are incredibly complex social scenes in which these tools are deployed, and most work today in technology studies acknowledges the ‘technosocial’ scene as important to theorizing a tool. But even before dealing with the scenes of tool usage, I found that I had an incredibly difficult time finding many good resources on feminisms and digital technology of the sort used in digital archives.

I launched the website on December 20, 2013, seven days after Beyonce dropped her first digital album, Beyonce, and four days after I published an online case study about Renisha McBride. I was in my third year of graduate school drafting ideas for my dissertation. I had time and creative juices to spare. All of these factors, including the demand for “collecting receipts” on Twitter influenced the form and function of Hashtag Feminism. Over the next several months, I worked with feminist writers who I met on Twitter, to build an online platform that reflected the culture and politics of the so-called hashtag activism era. In 2015, about a year into my dissertation, I realized I spent more money and time than I could afford trying to maintain the site while also paying writers. The website was being hacked around the time of GamerGate and targeted harassment of feminist media online. It was also around this time that I lost content on the site. A Columbia professor and his students hosted a #Feminism hack-a-thon to try to help retrieve some of the content, but ultimately, the Hashtag Feminism I started in 2013 was gone.",

The website uses appropriated footage that represents both the internet and the vagina. The project teases out an alternative history of the world wide web, pornography, and women’s bodies. The website critiques the dearth of representations of female anatomy, within and beyond pornography, and its relative cultural unimportance as compared to phallic imagery. By evoking a 1990s aesthetic—a time when mainstream consumers first got online—the website confronts the commercialization of the Internet that was accomplished using women’s bodies. The vagina is mapped onto how the popular visual imagination conceives the physical presence of the internet as an endless, tunneling space (as seen in The Matrix, Hackers, and Lawnmower Man), which, in the context of VVVVVV, becomes what I call a “cyberpussy.” The site maps out new theoretical potentialities for gender, technology, and sex.",

Organizations focusing on building women’s capacity to use ICTs effectively were born, such as Women’sNet in South Africa, Women of Uganda Network (WOUGNET) in Uganda and Linux Chix Africa. Collaborative networks were created such as FLAMME, a network of African women online, committed to strengthening the capacity of women through the use of ICTs to lobby, advocate and participate in the Beijing +5 process. Powerful and inclusive methodologies were used to develop platforms and networks. Both FLAMME and Women’sNet brought women from organizations across Africa together to share skills and build capacity in creating websites and facilitating mailing lists.",

The research presents how transgender people converge at a popular transgender site to share their struggles in transitioning, including treatment options, unlearning dominant gender norms, celebrating achieved milestones and exchange experiences of discrimination faced.",

I will try to analyze and plot this notion’s political coordinates, in a space that has, with somewhat different and sometimes conflicting ends, been mapped out by cyberfeminist research (by Alison Adam and Sarah Kember, for instance). The idea that artificial intelligence seems to crystallize, for many accelerationists, is something like an “emancipation of intelligence,” as Nick Land once put it. The forking of accelerationism into the left and right spectra can be seen as so many ways of articulating this idea and forging it into a programme: whether in the form of a neoreactionary demand for private exit (AGI as a line of flight), or the form of a cybersocialist push towards the rational social cognition (AGI as Geist).",

While it is worth noting here that my references to “the commons” are in critical conversation with existing formulations of the “digital commons,” an aim of Queer OS vis-à-vis conceptualizations of commons is to provide a society-level oper-ating system (and perhaps an operating system that can run on computer hardware) to facilitate and support imaginative, unexpected, and ethical relations between and among living beings and the environment, even when they have little, and perhaps nothing, in common.",

Sensors in automobiles might respond to a stressed out driver with softer light or upbeat music. Commercial surveillance applications increasingly measure facial movements to profile the reactions of customers. Meanwhile data is collected on social networks for engineering relationships. A team of social media researchers recently proposed an ‘early breakup warning system’ for Twitter that is possible with just public available data. Affective computing is automating the largely undervalued and often gendered work known as ‘emotional labor.’ A nanny, waitress, community manager, journalist, administrator assistant, or counselor is subject to the fallacious conflation of ‘doing what she loves‘ and labor, and therefore often underpaid for her services. Attempts to automate care work could reveal the complexity and difficulty of professions that demand social intelligence, expressive emotion, and creativity.",

On the one hand, Internet has given space to the advancement of Human Rights including Human Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual, Transgender, Intersex and Queer (LGBTIQ). On the other hand, the technology creates a space, which preserves status quo, discrimination and violence against LGBTIQ that has previously been evident in offline spaces. That is, due to the lack of human rights protection of LGBTIQ on Internet governance, as is the lack of security in the same physical space. Harassment and homophobic bullying, which include online delivery of hate speech against the LGBTIQ referred to as cyber-homophobia is among the behaviors appearing in social network and other cyber spaces. The blockade of LGBTIQ websites by several Internet Service Providers (ISP) has been happening since 2011. The act is often a one-sided decision without prior notification to the owner of the website. More often than not, the process is committed by both ISP and the Ministry of Communication and Informatics Republic of Indonesia, without a transparent and accountable consultation to the owner of the website. This is clearly detrimental to any individual or group in an effort to access information about human rights, reproductive rights and sexual rights.",

The umbrella term for the Black presence in sci-fi, technology, magic, and fantasy is a fairly modern creation, coined in 1994 by a culture critic named Mark Dery. Although we apply this term retrospectively to encompass speculative fiction, film, art, and music created by, or inclusive of, people of color, the concepts and phenomenon fueling Afrofuturism have been around for as long as there have been people to observe it and communicate it. Whether you call it mythology, ghost stories, cosmology, parable, folktale, sci-fi, religious tale, or fantasy, people of color have always contemplated their origins in the same breath that they anticipated the fate of humankind. We continue to do so, until the day that time leaves us all behind. These are our stories.",

[…] Women’s engagements with online technologies are often characterized as casual and social, and not hardcore. Such categorizations surface continually in gaming environments and open source programming communities. Thus, an offline gender divide maps on the binary of hardcore as expert, with knowledge of code, and social use of online spaces that requires less coding skill (however limited this coding skill) is characterized as casual and less literate. Gender divide always maps onto hardcore and soft. Women working in the technology industry tend to be in human resources, art, or secretarial positions doing community-management work. In turn, different social media sites are themselves gendered. […] The anonymous user is almost always assumed to be male.

I also wanted to know the edges of the territory I was allowed to inhabit or if it was truly as infinite as was suggested, and I truly wanted to find meaningful friendship there. In short, how and where and by whom would I be found here? So, we are all collectively echolocating ourselves in this ever-expanding virtual landscape.

The mutual co-construction of conceptualisations of the Web as both an embodiment and facilitator of “openness” is not without its problems, however. In this brief (deliberately provocative) discussion we explore ways in which treating openness as a “universal good” ignores (and marginalizes) diversity in cultural practice and obscures the structures of power and control embedded in the processes of the cultural appropriation of knowledge. In this way, questioning the Web’s “openness” is a mechanism by which to explore the digital divide, the inherent politics of the Web as a socio-technical infrastructure and the historical processes that have led to its continued development.",

Kendall’s hashtag activism quickly began trending and reignited a discussion about the trouble with white feminism. A number of journalists have excoriated Kendall specifically, and women of color more generally, for contributing to a “toxic” form of feminism. Yet what remains unquestioned in these journalistic accounts and in the scholarship to date, is the dominance of white women as architects and defenders of a framework of white feminism—not just in the second wave but today, in the digital era. […] I offer a critique of white feminisms as it plays out on the intersectional Internet.",

As in other recent accounts, analogue tools sat next to these devices. […] Such juxtapositions call into question the kinds of activity identified as ‘technology’ in line with common definitions of do-it-yourself culture that contest mainstream technology development. In addition to challenging  technology  conventions, we found the notion of hacking as dabbling or tinkering trumped by the seriousness and care with which members approached their non-digital work.

Realized in collaboration with an ensemble of music, sound, video, and lighting artists, three vignettes address the vexed relationship between the ephemeral nature of digital information and the drive for historical documentation in cyberspace, particularly as it relates to closed servers, bounced URLs, and Google cache. Huxtable, who approaches the Web as a vital resource for narratives that are usually discarded or placed in the margins of history, considers how the Internet has evolved from a largely text-based medium to one propelled by the power of visual symbols. She imagines these virtual spaces as twilight zones of desire, where music, dramatic oration, video, and the presence of human and digital characters coalesce into an immersive, schizophrenic experience that traverses topics as diverse as black samurai, trans-healers in South Africa, pre-colonial globalism, and human evolution.",

In the four-part conference presentation where Haraway introduced her cyborg to US audiences, I went first because my view was more standard and even “retro” compared to where Donna wanted to take us. For I was one of those feminists reproducing all those dualisms of “white capitalist patriarchy”; I was on about the woman-nature / man-machine connections […] With typical postgraduate self-centredness, I paid little attention to Haraway’s cyborg while working on my own ambiguous metaphors and myths of high technology and science fiction like the brain-womb, the spermatic word, the penis-breast, the cannibal eye. […] I saw Frankenstein’s monster and the cyborg as equivalent technosex fantasies, whereas Haraway placed them on different sides of her chart contrasting the logics of “white capitalist patriarchy” with those of “the informatics of domination.”",

Ramírez] asked us to reconsider how twenty-first-century technologies are a site of power and of resistance to that power by American mestizas and mestizos, primarily those who identify as Chicana or Chicano. The umbrella term for this new point of inquiry, Chicanafuturism, encompasses all Chicana/o art that situates itself at the intersection of technoscience and Chicana/o culture. This is art that, although interested in questions of form, genre, and style, is deeply attuned to the impacts of new technologies (in the past, present, and still undetermined future) on Chicana/o and Mexican indigenous cultures and communities. Similar to Afrofuturism, which Ramírez herself cites as a theoretical inspiration, Chicanafuturism is a type of cultural production—in literature, film, visual art, and music—that repurposes the “familiar memes of science fiction” to imagine, interrogate, and invent not only new political realities but also new cultural identities. Now more visible than ever, in both the academy and pop culture, today’s Afrofuturist and Chicanafuturist artists and writers embody the potent fusions made possible when science fiction sets its imaginative sights on the experiences, conditions, and political demands of people of color.",

She shows how contemporary surveillance technologies and practices are informed by the long history of racial formation and by the methods of policing black life under slavery, such as branding, runaway slave notices, and lantern laws. Placing surveillance studies into conversation with the archive of transatlantic slavery and its afterlife, Browne draws from black feminist theory, sociology, and cultural studies to analyze texts as diverse as the methods of surveilling blackness she discusses: from the design of the eighteenth-century slave ship Brooks, Jeremy Bentham'sPanopticon, andThe Book of Negroes, to contemporary art, literature, biometrics, and post-9/11 airport security practices. Surveillance, Browne asserts, is both a discursive and material practice that reifies boundaries, borders, and bodies around racial lines, so much so that the surveillance of blackness has long been, and continues to be, a social and political norm.",

This poem I found online; it reads, “The thirty degrees of your smile can not be found on Baidu.” I pictured this poem as depicting a heart-broken guy looking for his former girlfriend’s picture on Instagram. Her perfect, charming, unique smile cannot be found because Instagram is blocked in China. Therefore, he had to search for her smile on Baidu, aka: “Hundred degrees,” and found nothing. […] Blocking off parts of the internet is an unpleasant and manipulative action by the authorities which already has a long history in China.

Our goal is to continue to advance a theory of queerness as technological, operative, and systemic, derived from individual interests, mutual concern, and discussions that have emerged from collective presentations, virtual discussions, and queer dreams. It is to engage with the challenge of understanding queerness today as operating on and through digital media and the digital humanities. Our intervention therefore seeks to address what we perceive as a lack of queer, trans, and racial analysis in the digital humanities, as well as the challenges of imbricating queer/trans/racialized lives and building digital/technical architectures that do not replicate existing systems of oppression. As such, this is a speculative proposition for a technical project that does not yet exist and may never come to exist, a project that does not yet function and may never function. It is a response to the requirement that the digital humanities create working technologies. In lieu of tools, we offer up theoretical vaporware, speculative potentialware, ephemeral praxis.",

The xenofeminist challenge is not simply to reject universality, which we view as having considerable political utility, but to contest for and to re-engineer the universal. This is why we seek to position the universal as a kind of “mutable architecture that, like open source software, remains available for perpetual modification and enhancement.” Far from transcending the concerns of the social, the universal demands to be understood as the perpetually unfinished business of the political. But I can appreciate that we have a lot more to do in order to demonstrate this to some of our unconvinced allies.",

    "excerpt": "Teknolust is a contemporary Frankenstein story, with gender reversals. While Mary Shelley was the first to write about how Artificial Intelligence animated through electricity as a monster, Teknolust, focuses on bio-technology, virtual life and spiritual machines which can become our friends, guides or even lovers. Imagine a world in which there is a blurring between the soul and the chip, a world in which artificially implanted DNA is genetically bred to create enlightened and self-replicating intelligent machine which, perhaps, use a human body as a vehicle for mobility. According to several experts, this premise is not science fiction but actually plausible in the near future. The relationship of humans to technology and the unknown threat of biogenetics is one of the more vital areas of contemporary life. The provocations of a compelling vision for a future in which evolution is continually reformatting our dreams and digital enhancements, one by one, add solidity to this era’s newly formed cyborgian spine were appealing enough to create this film, which, though a comedy, hopefully sets forth some of the issues of our era.",

The bureaucratic projects of development and empowerment seek a brave, new, technical civilisation in which human beings are split into two classes: “social engineers” (read privileged white men) who define problems and the “engineered” who are only acted upon (read subaltern women). The ideology of data, driving policy makers towards this utopia, requires that algorithms determine (and even replace) deliberation and discussion. Citizens are serviced, individually, as clients whose data becomes the basis for governance. Deliberation is managed through technology, with resolute faith in the representativity of Twitter town halls. And women’s active citizenship is assumed to be addressed through bridging the gender digital divide. Citizenship itself is thus held to ransom by the “network-data complex”—the powerful alliance between “big-tech companies and their benefactor governments” furthering a neo-liberal capitalist model of development.",

As a thought experiment, it asks what fusing the mathematical-generative power of computers with an emancipatory gender-politics could achieve.

Initially operating within the vein of tactical media, socially engaged art and artistic activism – the performance presents the story of an artist’s shift from goal-oriented activism to a more complicated and embodied ethnography of an online community extremely hostile toward and easily mobilized against women who self-identify as feminists. If feminists hope for feminism to have any relevancy in American publics broader than the art world, Tumblr and academia, they must adopt a model which is both empathetic to even the perspectives they disagree with and emblematic of the futures they aspire toward.",

The region is home to some of the world’s oldest, most advanced civilizations, with lasting legacies of artistic, cultural, and scientific innovation of widespread influence. Asian philosophical traditions such as Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Buddhist and Islamic have also stood the test of time, serving as the foundational principles of governance, education, social interaction, and enterprise. The transformations in Asia’s increasingly digitized sociotechnological landscape are as much shaping, as being shaped by, these enduring cultural and philosophical traditions. Yet the analytical frames used to understand the impact of digital media on Asia predominantly originate from the Global North, neither rooted in Asia’s sophisticated intellectual heritage nor reflective of the sociocultural practices of this dynamic region.

The campaign, #KissMyArs, exposed the problematic politics of the Golden Nica, the top prize awarded by the Ars Electronica Festival in Linz, Austria: for over thirty years, the Golden Nica has almost exclusively been given to men. The #KissMyArs campaign went viral, bringing attention to and instigating a debate about the gender inequality of the award. […] Ars Electronica never responded. This was the autumn of 2016, in the wake of Trump and Brexit. It was no longer enough to problematize the present—we needed bold new visions of the future and ideas from outside the mainstream. After two years of naming the problem, it was time to create new structures to elevate the voices of those working at the intersection of art, science, and technology who were not being heard and who could offer fresh perspectives on this transdisciplinary practice—and REFRESH was born.

    "excerpt": "Black cyberfeminist theory bridges gaps in current theory and method in Internet Studies, as well as various other disciplinary modes of studying the Internet. Status groups are constantly morphing but the power relationships that define status groups are remarkably stable. Focusing on categorical descriptions to the exclusion of process conflates compositional change for structural change. […] If the aim is to understand the nature of contemporary inequality, there is value in discerning the life chances of poor white women in Western nations distinctly from those of poor second generation Congolese immigrants in a Western nation. Algorithmic stratification would account for the intersections of history and biography that define integrative intersectionality under contemporary structural conditions. As privatization complicates datafication, neo-liberalism weakens social reforms, and capital further inserts its way into how we live our daily lives on the Internet, intersectionality is critical to Internet studies and social science. Algorithmic stratification’s focus on process, both online and off, across intersecting power relations is a way to move the study of contemporary inequalities forward.",

The encrypted communication network was set up as part of Operation Vula to attempt to launch a people's war and ultimately liberate a people's from apartheid. This article speaks to the history of technology in its attempts to further document and elucidate the encrypted communication network. To accomplish this, it draws both on previously available sources and also personal accounts obtained through interviews with some of the core individuals involved in the network's functioning. It also aims at expanding our understanding of highly intentional, politically-motivated practices of hacking, and the socio-technical infrastructures needed for such practices to exist.” —Sophie Toupin",

The binomial culture / nature structures an almost infinite list of other binomials found in modern Western thought: man / woman, white / non-white, straight / queer, science / witchcraft, adult / child, normal / abnormal … The second term of each binomial is associated with nature and is therefore subdued to the same regime of violence. Through heterotrophy carried out to its maximum, necropolitics is constituted so that it literally “consumes” everything on this planet. “Protecting nature” seems to be a bad idea … It is strange that one has come to accept that an individual, delimited by the skin, constitutes a living being, but the planet as a whole doesn’t.",

Nelson explains how these cutting-edge DNA-based techniques are being used in myriad ways, including grappling with the unfinished business of slavery: to foster reconciliation, to establish ties with African ancestral homelands, to rethink and sometimes alter citizenship, and to make legal claims for slavery reparations specifically based on ancestry.”",

Oram’s approach to electronic sound and music was innovative and inspiring, encouraging anyone with an interest in music to think about the nature and capabilities of electronic sound and the new possibilities it offered. Her discussion wasn’t limited to the future of the orchestra, synthesizer, computer and home studio. She also ventured, with great spirit and wit, into other realms of science, technology, culture and thought. An Individual Note is a playful yet compelling manifesto for electronic music.

Glitched bodies vivify and live on via the material of the Internet; thus these bodies, always online, remain current in their presence, and, as such are not placed within the quiet annals of history. They stretch beyond an archival construct as yoked to or embedded within a specific moment in time. The mythologies as driven by narrative history only surface in the 20/20 perspective that comes with the privileges of hindsight. It is the archiving of material that allows for those perspectives to deepen as time passes. […] Counter to this, the glitched body remains contemporary, rejects historical processing, and celebrates its disorder as a mark of success within a social system that strangles with the fetishism of categorisation.

This is not a purely scientific question of how to chemically make estrogen like some kind of covert meth lab, let alone appropriating said protocols to fit the modest instruments of a kitchen. It requires uncovering the socio-political history of hormones, how they were assigned their institutional biopower, and how their pervasive presence in our environments problematizes our social notions of gender. The act of “hacking” not only refers to the hacking of organisms, hardware, and protocols—it represents equally the unearthing of deeply entrenched notions (black-boxed knowledge) of sex and gender, and the various ways institutions both regulate and pollute our bodies and bodies of nonhuman species. For example when I work with collaborators and participants to extract estrogenic pollutants from a local river, not only do we translate esoteric laboratory protocols into feasible “recipes,” we also begin to investigate the institutional actors who have “queered” the river and how we can move beyond (now) knowing these scandalous levels of estrogen in the environment (how to be of-a-world).",

Partly, this is to recognise just how justified the OBN and other cyberfeminists were when they pointed to the perils of self-definition. Articulating identities is indeed fraught with risks. As [James Pei-Mun] Tsang points out, it would be ill-advised to “disavow declarative function, but we must productively work with the fact that it continuously breaks down.” In talking of “n hypotheses”, we acknowledge the inevitability of this breakdown—the inability of any single declaration to capture our intentions, for example, or the probable failure of any given articulation to galvanize a collective political will in the ways that we might hope. We point to the strategic necessity of articulating (and thereby generating) a political identity without foreclosing in advance what that identity might mean. The iterative and open-ended nature of “n hypotheses” (reminiscent of both gender performativity and Butlerian approaches to hegemony building) stresses their availability for emendation and our appreciation of the fact that any emancipatory political project must incessantly revise its commitments.",

This project uses insights from machine learning analytics, design thinking iterations and interventions to investigate varying methods of creating a feminist data set. Feminist Data Set proposes an intersectional feminist antidote to the default usage of patriarchal language. The work asks: can data collection itself function as an artwork? Can it act as a form of protest?",

With safety and security frequently highlighted as surveillance’s goals, one reason for this void seems to be that the harms of surveillance in the digital age continue to remain too abstract for many people. […] “If you’ve got nothing to hide, you’ve got nothing to fear,” they continue to believe. And that is that. If you really have nothing to hide, that speaks rather poorly about the quality of your inner life—and I am not arguing this merely to be provocative. Experiencing doubt, uncertainty and shame is integral to every person’s growth as a human being; it is what makes us human. […] But what is perhaps even more important to highlight is that such arguments also hide from view this: being comfortable with revealing things about yourself often requires privilege. If your own identity and background fits closely within dominant norms—say if you are upper middle class, Hindu upper caste, male and heterosexual in India—you stand far less to lose by revealing details about who you are than if you are a poor, dalit, lesbian woman.",

Many of these focus on the important task of uncovering women’s contributions and adding them back into the historical record. […] Understandably, many of these studies focus on women who have a claim to greatness or whose activities put them at the center of major historical events—like Grace Hopper, the ENIAC women, or Dame Stephanie Shirley. Yet the experiences of these exceptional women only begin to hint at the story of most women in computing. They are as much exceptions to the rule as the handful of great men whose achievements have come to define the contours of computer lore. Even the focus on more ordinary women who could lay claim to the identity of programmer risks obscuring the much larger group of women who worked with computers, many of whom programmed, without it defining their job or personal identity. Career-based identities historically privilege a male subject, rarely taking into account the often circuitous and discontinuous nature of women’s working lives or the social pressures placed upon women to privilege nonprofessional categories in constructing their identities.",

What’s interesting to me about thinking about black feminism within the context of post-cyberfeminism is that it allows us the space to think about and possibly reclaiming the idea of utopia, especially in digital spaces. What’s so interesting about reading anything about the internet at the turn of the last century was this utopian idea of what the internet could offer us, in terms of a new way of thinking about feminism, a new way of thinking beyond gender, a new way of thinking about our politics. And, of course, as we know, none of that happened. These hopeful visions of the internet have collapsed under the weight of industrial-scale racism, sexism, misogyny, and facism. This wasn’t even conceived of in the 90s under Web 1.0. Given the context of a racist and sexist digital capitalism, how can we think of possible radical futures?",

Questions asked include how the media can better contribute to assist in gender development and nation-building. How can online platforms make a difference? This article provides a critical summary of feminist theoretical perspectives on the potential of online communications for the advancement of women’s rights, further providing a brief case study of contemporary Brazilian feminism and the mobilization around women’s rights, particularly in 2015.",

In many respects, the Internet is viewed as a gender-neutral space and platform upon which feminist messages can be broadcast with less government surveillance and interference than in “real” (not digital) spaces. Many Iranian feminists emphasize the positive and empowering aspects of this new technology for conveying feminist ideas and raising gender awareness. Cyberspace, and the digital tools used to access it, offer a wide public forum for women’s activists to broadcast rights-based campaigns originating from and for Iran. As a key example, for many Iranian women, the medium of cyberfeminism not only allows access and engagement with domestic and transnational debates on gender equality issues and anti-discriminatory legislation, but also provides a space in which to narrate personal stories and exchange views on taboo-laden subjects such as sexuality, divorce, questioning hejab, and religious teachings.",

How the approaches and theoretical frameworks of both the examinations of reproductive justice and the examinations of Post-Cyber Feminism can talk to each other and give us a set of demands and transformative frameworks. The heuristics of our schools of feminist thought have really failed to adequately provide either a comprehensive critique of injustice for the reproductive freedoms that people experience, or really a utopian horizon for what reproductive justice might look like. If one solely fixates on the boardroom, we raise the more urgent politics of what happens in the bedroom and, these days, in the chatroom. What do we mean by reproduction? There’s the obvious sense in which this has to do with making babies.

It is not a black accelerationism—that is, a ‘black perspective on accelerationism’—nor is it an accelerationist theory of blackness. It is not a critique of accelerationism from the position of blackness or black studies. These are notes on blaccelerationism. This portmanteau—binding blackness and accelerationism to one another—proposes that accelerationism always already exists in the territory of blackness,(481)whether it knows it or not—and, conversely, that blackness is always already accelerationist. It is my modest proposition that activating this blaccelerationism serves to articulate a necessary alternative to right and left accelerationism.” —Aria Dean",

These efforts affirm the presence of Indigenous peoples in the technological future and ensure the capacities of Indigenous people to create their own roles in digital culture. These are not mainstream images of the future focused on the myth of the pioneering individual. Instead, we see in AbTeC’s body of work cohesive and collective visions of the future enabled by communities and grounded in shared priorities. Through this impressive set of achievements, the research network has become an international criterion for active participation in digital cultures and a model for developing long-lasting community engagements.

Plant’s important work on teledildonics functions as a descriptive and pervasive experience of computing. However, the computer mouse as vulva offers an important corrective to the dominance of patriarchal motifs in technology. I contend the vulva mouse presents a counter to the sexualization of technology that reinscribes a heteronormative phallocentricism. Instead of jacking in, the vulva mouse clicks, offering the power of the click or clit.",

For Tsing, encounters open new possibilities for thinking. They produce transformation and are therefore indeterminate. They are also non-human centered. (550) There can be encounters between different species—say a mushroom and a pine tree—or between lifeforms and non-human materials. Components of a system are implied to be static discrete units, leaving out processes of contamination and transformation. For example when predator-prey relations are described as transfers of energy between components in a system, say a walrus eats a mollusc, it is inferred that the walrus remains unchanged by the encounter. Seeing the world as made up of individuals sealed off from one another, allows for the assumption of stable categories, and makes the world easier to quantify through data, interpreted as pattern and codified as algorithm.",

The blog’s pan-African and diasporic following has enabled me to connect with African women in deep and intimate ways. […] In order to have an even broader understanding of the experiences of African women around sex and sexualities I will be conducting a global survey on the sex lives of African Women. The results of this survey and the learnings I have gained from facilitating conversations on sex and sexuality for close to a decade will be documented as a resource for the African feminist movement. My belief is that this will be a useful source for the numerous activists working for the sexual rights of African Women all over the continent in support of the political agenda that is foundational to “Adventures from the Bedrooms of African women”—and to contribute to the freedom of African women such that we can thrive in our sexual choices, desires, and all other areas of our lives.",

This compelling myth tells us that, once upon a time, modern computers were big (and maybe even bad) mainframes. […] Computer technology, in this mythology, is far removed from everyday life until it reaches the users. […] Time-sharing networks emerged neither from individual genius not from the military-industrial complex; rather, they were created for—and by—students and educators at universities and public schools as civilian, civic-minded projects. […] For the students and educators, sharing was a feature, not a bug, of the networks. […] I introduce the concept of “computing citizens” to describe those who access time-sharing networks. […] This is a broad and inclusive definition of citizenship, mirroring the ways in which the advocates of time-sharing networks envisioned computing access as broad and inclusive.",

Tech companies offer forgiveness and even encouragement for misusing and abusing electronic devices, for example on Black Friday. Online services and apps create an illusion of seamless interaction between computational devices and data which evaporate into thin air after their life cycles. None of this make-believe is true.

Contrary to the decentralization and democratization promised by the internet, five major corporations (the so-called “GAFAM”—Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft—along with a few others that centralize services on a global scale, such as Uber, Airbnb, Despegar and MercadoLibre), hold the monopoly on internet operations. This demonstrates how cyberspace has become a territory for struggles for power and narrative.

So once the metals are extracted from the earth, shippers transport them to factories which are located primarily in Asia.

In the process, bodies and their stories are filtered through expert opinions. Judges, case workers, country data, and at times even Google search results take precedence over queer and trans experience.

Firstly, the underlying mechanisms and frameworks of the information economy and the ‘sharing economy’, and the materials and resources are being extracted for this. And secondly at the individual level of bodies: people and their agency. We want to be able to shift in between structure with bodies, the macro and the micro. As Jac [Kee] said ‘You can enter at the level of bodies, the labour they engage in, the data that they generate, the context of their economy, their histories of colonialism. This would shift the question from a simplistic understanding of ICTs as empowerment.’” —Dr. Becky Faith",

Socially progressive in intent, yet irrevocably tied to a utilitarian bottom line, “dotcom neoliberalism,” as it was termed by the authors, results in a blind faith acceptance of information technology’s “emancipatory potentiality.” The emancipatory potentiality of technology is the very basis of cyberfeminism—confusing given the otherwise progressive thinking of its members, but perhaps admissible with thirty years of hindsight on our side. More confusing, then, is post-cyberfeminism’s retention of this techno-utopian ethos.",

Due to their high cost and low functionality, in her current instantiation, Bina48 is a robot without a body. Her sculptural bust is set upon a table next to the computer tower. However, care is taken to make Bina48 look as “human” as possible: the AI is dressed in a casual sweater and a blonde wig. […] This essay examines some implications of Bina48’s bodily absence, or what can be called her ‘shadow’ body, as one that both acknowledges and effaces the history of African American women’s reproductive labor in the United States. In this sense, this essay challenges the progressive technological narratives of cryonics and artificial intelligence that promise liberation from the body. As an AI modeled after a black African American woman, Bina48’s bodily absence engages questions of property, ownership, and reproduction, areas where arguments concerning the non-human status of both the slave and artificial intelligence intersect. The comparisons between the slave and robot/artificial intelligence are complicated by black women’s role as reproducers under institutional slavery and in light of current debates concerning race, technology, and reproductive justice.",

She is the demon-spawn of the primordial feminine that has manipulated males into serving as a heat sink for evolution and that is now discarding them towards an alien and inhuman machinic future. She mutates from castration, from the creation of the Acéphallus, the phallus perverted into a purposeless desire for desire’s sake. In this castration, in this mutation into an Acéphallus, she becomes the Body without Sex Organs: The body in a virtual state, ready to plug its desire into technocapital, becoming fused with technocapital as a molecular cyborg who is made flesh by the pharmaceutical-medical industry. She enters into the world as a hyper-sexist backlash at the logic of the gender binary. She takes gender and accelerates it, transforming into a camouflaged guerrilla. The trans woman is an insurgent against patriarchy who is continually flanking it, introducing an affirmative zero into the gender binary, the affirmative zero which reaches ever more configurations in the downward cascade of gender fragmentation away from the binary and ultimately away from the human itself. It is a process of gender shredding where the feminine wins out in a cybernetic warfare against the crumbling tower of the masculine, and where therefore human reproduction becomes impossible.",

By responding to/with trouble, rather than designing solutions to problems,staying with the trouble through designaims to better understand the conflicts and responsibilities involved in complex social, cultural and political issues, in order to imagine and design still possible futures. The design methodology interweaves three practices that unfold the self-reflective, ethnographic and collaborative process ofstaying with the trouble through design. The first practice, the willful practice ofStaying with the Wrong, is a continuous process of becoming a feminist designer and it includes actively learning to be present; question the given as given, stay with the feelings you wish would go away, continuously practice self-reflection on own positionality and using feminist humour when designing with taboos. The second practice,Curious Visiting, encourages the designer to go beyond their own positionality, by listening to stories of pleasure and pain and visiting ongoing pasts and alternatives nows. This challenges the designer’s notion of the present by interweaving fact and fiction, and it highlights that this practice is never innocent but involves risks. Lastly, the third practiceCollective Imagininghighlights how design by proposing future change can respond to and/or with trouble and how we collectively can engage with futures to rewrite collective imaginings and tell other possible stories within and across social and cultural contexts. Together, these three interwoven practices propose a way of staying with the trouble through design, as a feminist contribution to current critical approaches within interaction design.",

    "excerpt": "How does a chatbot become sexist? According to Josie Young’s research, it’s usually incorporated into the chatbot’s design and amplified through day-to-day conversations with humans. From only responding to commands from male voices to tolerating abusive language, tech companies are incorporating regressive ideas and unconscious bias into AI. (572) Not only is this a sign of lazy design, says Josie, but attempting to replicate ourselves in AI is stifling innovation and the potential of this technology. An advocate for designing AI products and systems using ethical and feminist principles, Josie argues that we should be using this technology to heal society’s problems, instead of adding to them. With this in mind, she has created a practical tool for teams to use when building a bot, prompting developers to question their own bias and training them to address these issues themselves in the future.",

    "excerpt": "In the group showProducing Futures—An Exhibition on Post-Cyber-Feminisms, (556) the Migros Museum für Gegenwartskunst surveys the causes championed by feminists in the post-internet era. Our virtual and real lives are almost inextricably interwoven today. Yet contrary to the heady proclamations of the cyberfeminists of the 1990s, cyberspace has not evolved into a realm of unclouded liberation and self-empowerment; it has also served to reinforce existing hierarchies and power structures. Opening with a new work by the artists’ collective VNS Matrix, which coined the term cyberfeminism, the presentation revisits the movement’s historic aspirations and visions, contrasts them with the contemporary situation, and inquires into ways in which its ideas may still be productive. The exhibition undertakes a critical engagement with different feminist approaches that put the spotlight on the tension between body and technology and on discriminatory gender norms. […] Many of the works pursue a holistic view, drawing on (medical) science, the occult, and other fields to stimulate a more comprehensive discussion and generate ideas for a livable future of emancipation, gender justice, and social equality.",

These “Simulists” simultaneously embrace and subvert technology as their means of interrogation–expressing humanist, nonbinary, and decolonized futures. Curated by Kelani Nichole and featuring works by Morehshin Allahyari, (660) LaTurbo Avedon, Meriem Bennani, Snow Yunxue Fu, Claudia Hart, Faith Holland, (382) Lorna Mills, Eva Papamargariti, Tabita Rezaire, (450) and Lu Yang, the exhibition explores identity, the body, and the politics of technology. Virtual space is inhabited with queer bodies and cultural identity is reclaimed through subversive uses of technology. The boundaries of technology and the body are blurred, as are the lines between author, image, and copy. Possible futures emerge as the layers of simulation that mediate contemporary culture are revealed.",

She goes for an alarming ride in a driverless car, concluding “the cyborg future is not coming any time soon”; uses artificial intelligence (388) to investigate why students can’t pass standardized tests; deploys machine learning to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster; and attempts to repair the US campaign finance system by building AI software.

Initially LB City was planned to be a live stream platform that ended up becoming a social platform imagining the alternative “lesbian” society. (83) The LB City community used “lesbian” as an antithesis to Korean patriarchical heteronormativity and hoping to nurture socially inclusive language and culture. Interview from personweb in 2001 supports that the LB City’s use of “lesbian” extend beyond describing sexual orientation. “LB City’s ultimate goal is more than an attempt to create an entertainment website for queer women. We are preparing for the society where qeer women can live freely. So LB City is a Beta test for that world where we can practice inclusive living. Eventually this shouldn’t stop in online but implement in reality. Therefore this project is more so than city planning for Lesbians but thinking about what it means to speak in lesbian, sing in lesbian and dream with fellow lesbian citizens.”",

Interested in rupturing these systems, Refiguring the Future is inspired by artist Morehshin Allahyari’s use of “refiguring” as a feminist, decolonial, and activist practice. (559) In this exhibition, we seek to “refigure the future”: to push, probe, tear apart, and re-envision what the future can be. Looking beyond the status quo, we sought out feminist, queer, decolonial, anti-racist, and anti-ableist artists concerned with our technological and political moment. Informed by the punk ethos of DIY, the artists in Refiguring the Future deeply mine the historical and cultural roots of our current moment, pull apart the artifice of contemporary technology, and sift through the pieces to forge new visions of what is possible. Working across an array of mediums and approaches—from analog books to augmented reality (AR)—these artists address and examine a tumultuous present in order to produce a more inclusive future.",

From the 1960s to present, the book examines how computing technology has been used to neutralize the threat that black people pose to the existing racial order, but also how black people seized these new computing tools to build community, wealth, and wage a war for racial justice.Through archival sources and the voices of many of those who lived and made this history,Black Softwarecentralizes African Americans’ role in the Internet's creation and evolution, illuminating both the limits and possibilities for using digital technology to push for racial justice in the United States and across the globe.” —Summary by the publisher Oxford University Press",

Describing the device as “a tool of witchcraft and magic,” (643) Allahyari reframes 3-D scanning as a performative, embodied act with open-ended political potential. Working with a selection of replicas of cultural artifacts from the Middle East, Allahyari will perform live 3-D scans while speaking about the objects’ long histories as symbols and relics and their recent appropriation (320) in digital form by Western institutions, considering how these narratives intersect materially and poetically and how they may be resituated and rewritten.",

Yet surprisingly few women participate in it: rates of involvement by technologically skilled women are drastically lower in hacking communities than in industry and academia. (220) […] Christina Dunbar-Hester shows that within this well-meaning volunteer world, beyond the sway of human resource departments and equal opportunity legislation, members of underrepresented groups face unique challenges. She brings together more than five years of firsthand research: attending software conferences and training events, working on message boards and listservs, and frequenting North American hackerspaces. She explores who participates in voluntaristic technology cultures, to what ends, and with what consequences. Digging deep into the fundamental assumptions underpinning STEM-oriented societies, Dunbar-Hester demonstrates that while the preferred solutions of tech enthusiasts—their “hacks” of projects and cultures—can ameliorate some of the “bugs” within their own communities, these methods come up short for issues of unequal social and economic power. Distributing “diversity” in technical production is not equal to generating justice.",

Questions of technology are now bound together with questions of ecology and the economy. Online and oﬄine are no longer separate spheres, but have rather become a single continuum. […] Despite the great variety of existing positions, there is nevertheless something that binds them together; they all negotiate gender politics with reference to technology, and they all understand their praxis as an invitation to take up their social and aesthetic interventions, to carry on, and never give up. […] Their practices are networked, but often in the stratified, parallel universes of international art scenes, academic theory and research (primarily in the global North), political activism (primarily in the global South), and the techno-underground.

The textual archive of colonialism is littered with scenes of wondrous “first contact” (58) between colonized populations and machines, from phonographs to trains. The figure of the technological or the machinic was endowed with a powerful pedagogical function within such narratives, working to hail and retrain colonial subjects, rescuing them from the time of the pre-modern.

One definition of pandrogeny as framed by Genesis P-Orridge: “Pandrogyny is the conscious embracing of gender roles, sexual orientations, or cultural traditions so as to render the person’s original identity completely indecipherable. It is the ‘third gender’ (675) … a type of gender-neutral living being more akin to the OTHER … a pandrogyne is about making one’s life (a brief existence) into an art form. Is pandrogyny transvestism, transgendered behavior, or transsexuality? None of the above, as it turns out.”",

It was, of course, precisely the non-equivocal nature of white and Black women’s oppressions which motivated Kimberlé Crenshaw’s coining of the now widely used term “intersectionality,” which is liberally cited to support theXFM’s emancipatory agenda. More recently, Sirma Bilge has diagnosed the dilution, neutralization and erasure of race in its analytic use as a “whitening” of intersectionality; its establishment as a model in itself has also been variously assessed for its affordances and limitations. […] Pointing to this persistent Eurocentrism […] is a renewed call for attention to the dangers of glossing over the inequalities of race, gender, class, sexuality, ability and the real-existing politics of agency, which a presumed equivalence of oppression and in turn alienation evades. The “xeno” of xenofeminism uses alienness univocally and performs the marginalized position of “being alienated” whilst it elides the differences implicated in the dynamics of marginalization.",

Further, by performing identities that are highly visible, are constantly changing, and engage complex forms of authenticity through modes of camp and realness, drag queens (688) disrupt many common understandings about the users and uses of popular technologies, assumptions of the integrity of data, and even approaches to ensuring privacy. In this way, drag offers both a culturally specific framework for conceptualizing queer and trans responses to surveillance and a potential toolkit for avoiding, thwarting, or mitigating digital observation.",

This manifesto calls attention to the powerful, messy, non-innocent, contradictory, and nevertheless crucial work of what we name as “crip technoscience,” practices of critique, alteration, and reinvention of our material-discursive world. Disabled people are experts and designers of everyday life. But we also harness technoscience for political action, refusing to comply with demands to cure, fix, or eliminate disability. Attentive to the intersectional workings of power and privilege, we agitate against independence and productivity as requirements for existence.

Structural discrimination and marginalization can be demonstrated and explained through concrete examples. Just think of the impact socioeconomic background has on educational aspirations, of the very low percentage of women in political or business leadership positions, and of the rampant labor exploitation in the care sector. The following visual data essays at the intersection of editorial design and information visualization make complex issues pertaining to discrimination, systemic inequalities and marginalization accessible to a broader audience. Interdisciplinary teams of Design and European Media Studies students developed these short essays to explore the ways in which various axes of power/privilege and disadvantage such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, class, disability, sexual orientation and gender identity overlap to create unique dynamics and effects, also known as intersectionality. The course was conducted in cooperation with the Center for Intersectional Justice (CIJ).",

    "excerpt": "At the heart of this book lies the question: What happens when ordinary people try to define and tackle a large social problem? Tough open-technology communities possess features different from the culture at large, they nevertheless constitute a laboratory for the voluntaristic address of social inequality. One special feature is, of course, their orientation around technology, which means they are beholden to the cultural legacies of computing and engineering in important ways. Another is their level of commitment to self-governance and autonomy. The hacker ethic (252) includes a devotion to hands-on problem solving, which, this book argues, has led to open-technology enthusiasts trying to hack their communities in real time. In other words, some have addressed their communities with an approach that can be characterized as,Hey, our culture is informal and constituted by shared interest in taking things apart and putting them back together again, so how hard could it be to change?",

Learned from those before and with me (Sayers 2018; Zarzycka and Olivieri 2017), my cyberfeminism is first and foremost a method of doing well and for the better (Ahmed 2016; Gajjala 2019). It is hard to do (well) but easy enough to name (Fernández 2002 (206); Daniels 2009), and naming it up front is part of its best practices (@riotmango; Subrosa). Mine is situated: attending to the specificity of its place, time, and author(s) (Carpio 2019; Harpold and Philip 2010); and in this way committed: serving and driven by self- and world-changing goals (Losh and Wernimont 2018); connected and interactive: rooted in what humans and machines can build and do collectively (Braidotti 2012; Cardenas 2012); and ethical: while always attending to intensity and control between people and technologies (Laurel 2003; Nelson 2016); and thus rooted in care (McLeod, Rault, and Cowan 2014; Fotopoulou, Juhasz, and O’Riordan 2014), given all the attendant violence (Malkowski and Russworm 2017; FemTechNet (349)).",

The concept of a body houses within it social, political, and cultural discourses, which change based on where the body is situated and how it is read. When we gender a body, we are making assumptions about the body’s function, its sociopolitical condition, its fixity. When the body is determined as a male or female individual, the body performs gender as its score, guided by a set of rules and requirements that validate and verify the humanity of that individual. A body that pushes back at the application of pronouns, or remains indecipherable within binary assignment, is a body that refuses to perform the score. This nonperformance is a glitch.

By focusing on cyberfeminist art, (338) in particular, we explore its critical and emancipatory potentialities, as well as its participatory practice, and we come up with a conclusion that this form of expression can be seen as a means for creating fragments in the dominant system of power and forge spaces for rebellion against the contemporary networks of domination, oppression and exploitation. New forms of (political) communication have emerged in modern times. Cultural critics call it “postmodernism,” sociologists and political theorists perceive it as the “post-industrial” era, whereas anthropologists focusing on the effects of anthropocentrism over the environment human inhabit refer to it as “posthumanism.” No matter the term, it is indisputable that we are living in the era of information, which, thanks to digital technology, is operating at a very high speed and has reorganized former spatiotemporal fixes, making the whole world a global community.",

The pivotal question that Sobande asks which helps unpack the implications of the digital experience of the Black women is: why are the Black women identified as “trendsetters” while being both erased and “hyper-visible as creators?” (p. 1) This question is the focus of the book as Sobande delves into the issues, experiences and perspectives that are seldom addressed regarding the digital lives of Black women in Britain.",

However, in this essay, I note the ways that Haraway’s piece still exacerbates categories of difference, and my own difficulties and critiques of the cyborg identity. I encourage readers to not only consider its importance, but also the limits of the cyborg identity, and how the concept of cyborg itself is fraught with a Western, patriarchal violence that cannot be ignored in the greater context of technology and technological innovation. Although useful in imagining a departure from traditional categories of difference, I inquire as to whether it upholds the very things it purported to dismantle, and explore other scholars’ works in challenging the concept. Ultimately, “cyborgs” (526) are not outside of the politics within which they exist, and must be interpreted in relation to other identity categories without upholding whiteness and Western epistemologies as the center.",

However, cyberspace has been discoursed and materialized in a manner that frames it as commodified land, reproducing colonialsim as well as the exclusionary gendered and raced notions that undergird it. While feminist media studies plays an important role in critiquing various -isms in technological environments, it still could benefit from decolonial Native feminisms approaches in light of several problems in the field. For one, there is a rampant misunderstanding when conceptualizing Indigenous peoples as a race versus citizens of nations in discussions of identity politics and technology. Another separate, but important, issue regards a noticeable lack of Native feminist perspectives and citational erasures in feminist media studies. This prevents Indigenous cyber or networked feminist concerns from rising and represses different strains of “truth in the emotional content of this felt knowledge: colonialism as it is felt by those who experience it” (Dian Million 2008, 272).",

The Cyborg makes trouble in the 1980s, by searching for dangerous potentials found in human-machine-couplings. The Cunt makes trouble in the early 1990s, through its provocative relationship with male-dominant cyberculture. The Glitch makes trouble in the 2020s, by celebrating the error and exploring unlimited identities online. The resources target the binary system that reads the material body as either male or female, thus leading it to “perform” one or the other. This assumption is what each resource aims to trouble, by injecting itself into the system and by blurring the boundaries between the real and the digital, the human and the machine. The resources provide an opportunity to reimagine what a body means and how it can perform, online and AFK2 (“Away From Keyboard”).",

The publication ponders how to embrace alternative values in economies, for example focusing on locality, cooperation, and caring. During the launch events, we asked contributors, respondents, and readers questions on topics related to feminist finance such as patriarchy, care and infrastructure. A wave of valuable information, relevant links, references and questions ensued. We realized that we did not want this wealth of collective knowledge to get lost in the depths of Twitter. Inspired by an article by Valeria Graziano, Marcell Mars, and Tomislav Medak (Learning from #Syllabus) and their work on the Pirate Care syllabus, we decided to produce this Feminist Finance Syllabus.",

Sironiiberfeminizm, postmodernizmin yapıbozuma uğrattığı cinsiyet kimliğini siber kültürde yeniden inşa etmektedir. Ancak bu oluşumda cinsiyet kimliği, siber kimlikte ve siborg bedende cinsiyetsizleşebilme olanağına kavuşabilmektedir. Bu konuda, teknolojik gelişmeler sayesinde hem fiziki uzamda hem siber uzamda cinsiyet sınırlarının bulanıklaşması, diğer bir deyişle, cinsiyetin iki biçimli/heteronormatif yapıdan çok biçimli bir yapıya geçiş yapması veya görünmez olması mümkündür. Buradan hareketle, siberfeminizm siber kimliğin cinsiyet kimliğinden bağımsız olarak kurulabileceğini ve cinsiyetten kaynaklı eşitsizliklerinin siber kültürde kök salamayacağını savunmaktadır. Bu kitabın dijitalleşen dünyada cinsiyet ve kimlik konularına ışık tutacağı, siborg ve feminizm kavramlarına yeni ve farklı bir bakış açısı sunacağı düşünülmektedir.",

Artificial intelligence has primarily been used as a machine to make sense of, to categorize, to sort, and this is felt in an incredibly embodied way. It’s terrifying to think of this reductionist logic being used at a mass scale, being used to, literally, “identify.” In 2018, Michal Kosinski, a researcher of organizational behaviour and artificial intelligence, claimed to have developed an algorithm that could effectively determine someone’s sexual orientation. He was then in conversation with the Russian government on how to employ this algorithm. Of course, the validity of this “gaydar” algorithm has since been completely debunked. However, the logic of capture that is embedded in artificial intelligence systems through biased design can have and has had terrible consequences.",

    "excerpt": "We (Annie Goh and Marie Thompson) have previously used sonic cyberfeminisms as both a conceptual tool and an organising rubric for a series of events and projects that interrogate the relationship between gender, feminist praxis, sound and technology. The term first emerged as part of a panel discussion at the Berlin-based CTM Festival for experimental music and arts in 2014 entitled ‘Sound, Gender, Technology: Where To? With Sonic Cyberfeminisms’. This initial discussion was a loose attempt at exploring affinities between the sonic and cyberfeminist discourses of the 1990s, which this special issue continues and expands upon. A number of related events followed: an online reading group; a panel discussion at Goldsmiths, University of London; a two-day symposium at the University of Lincoln; a reading group at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London; and a week-long residency with ten participants at Wysing Arts Centre, Cambridge (with Robin Buckley, Marlo De Lara, Jane Frances Dunlop, Natalie Hyacinth, Miranda Iossifidis, Louise Lawlor, Frances Morgan and Shanti Suki Osman). The residency produced an hour-long sonic cyberfeminisms podcast and a zine; both were published online. Stemming from these events, and inspired by (cyber)feminist community-building projects such as female:pressure and the FACES mailing list, sonic cyberfeminisms have emerged as a small network that has continued to examine this set of issues.",

    "excerpt": "This paper analytically responds to the collaborative performance work Writing the Feminist Internet as a motif of fourth wave feminism. It probes at the edge of Internet dark spaces that are often occupied by those who point to complacency in engagement with networking systems, by drawing auxiliary attention to the apparatus. Further examination sheds light on the valences and anarchy of technopolitics that transpired and reflects on the call for ‘hybrid of feminist activist efforts’ noted by Emma A. Jane. Positing towards ‘a recalibrated approach to collectivism’, Jane continues to give rise to a vast communal realm for the expression of alternative behaviours. In building upon the feminist ‘wave’ metaphor there is acknowledgement that the undercurrents of nautical lineages come to endure through ‘debt, or inheritance’ more often than a confluence of flows. The findings reveal that the potency of a chthonic feminist internet theory lies in its indeterminate stance. In conclusion, it is proposed that ambivalence and prominence in obscurity in such expansive ‘dark social spaces’ is where new meanings and enunciations can brew and be read as a source of critical and aesthetic ambiguity, amongst the highly revered principles of disarray, pandemonium and incompleteness.",

In the late 20th century, digital technologies seemed poised to rework the boundaries of divides such as public and private, self and Other, masculine and feminine, or virtual and real. Drawing on posthumanist, transfeminist, and new materialist approaches in feminist thought, I analyze digital media interfaces as material sites of enacting and producing gender. In my fieldwork with young, mobile, urban cosmopolitans in early 2000s Berlin, many contested conventional gender, in ways tied to class status, even as they navigated implicit understandings of gender in interface design. I argue that these technologies must be analyzed as material interfaces or surfaces through which gender is constructed discursively and materially. Feminist technology and design scholars ask how new technologies and interfaces can support alternative, non-hegemonic enactments of gendered selfhood, as a means to challenge and rework how gender is constructed in and through sociotechnical systems. But such interventions require asking what exactly gender is online, as a virtual practice that combines the material with the informational in new ways.",

But what precisely does it mean to be “postdigital” if you are an Arab woman or social actor in the Global South? How does access to social networking sites, while increasing visibilities, also provide potential for increased agency? This study is concerned with the extent to which Arab women’s self-presentation practices on Instagram could be considered as empowering, or otherwise, within the postdigital condition. First, the study takes Instagram as a case to develop a theoretical framework for considering social media as a tertiary artifact, involving material, routine-symbolic, and conceptual affordances. Second, it applies the artifact framework to explore a corpus of self-presentations by five Arab women influencers. Feminist postdigital theorizing offers unique contributions to problematizing normative, ethnocentric, and neoliberal conceptions of Arab women’s empowerment. The application of the novel framework leads to an interpretative discussion of Arab women’s influencing practices across merging offline/online and transnational boundaries. Overall, the critical perspective begins to reimagine Arab women’s empowerment, not simply as individualized or material processes, but as agencies that are interwoven within the commercialized and conceptual dynamics of visual social media.",

In this study, a novel feminist semiotic framework is developed to explore the extent to which the Gothic female succubus either haunts or liberates Arab girls’ coming-of-age fictions. This issue is addressed via a feminist semiotic reading of the narratives of Middle Eastern woman author @Ranoy7, exploring the appeal of her scary stories presented on YouTube. Findings reveal tacit fears, ambivalences and tensions embodied within the Arab Gothic sign of the aging female succubus orjinn. Overall, the research develops feminist insights into the semiotic motif of the female jinn and its role in constituting Arab females as misogynistic gendered sign objects in the context of the social media story explored.",

I then argue that her cyberfeminist turn is motivated by the discovery that evermore autonomous machines are carving out a space outside the human spectacle from whence our anthropocentric misconceptions can be eliminated. If Plant characterizes this machinic critique as a feminism, it is because she sees increasingly intelligent machines as harbouring the same attributes often associated with women inasmuch as they have both been traditionally treated as a means to the ends of man without any rational agency, fixed identity or humanity of their own. As we shall see, Plant’s cyberfeminism is not so much about emancipating women as it is about emancipating feminine structures like irrationality, fluid identity, general intelligence, and even inhumanity, which she finds incarnated in emerging technologies as they spiral outside of man’s control in a purelyformal feminism, or even afeminism without women.",

This categorization has continued to exist and develop, and is now reflected in female figures in modern/contemporary film, TV, literature, and general pop culture; however, they have become increasingly nuanced and even subversive due to the change in how women have been treated in societies over time. The archaic and modern are therefore analogous, as one serves as a foundation for the other; however, they are simultaneously disparate due to the different time periods and the changes in societal attitudes concerning women.",

    "excerpt": "This program [SWEET PEA: YOUR OTHER PROGENY series] brings together artists, curators, and writers in the U.S. and Asia who were involved in cyberfeminist conversations on and offline during the early 2000’s, including artists exhibiting in feminist contexts, moderators of feminist discussion lists and organizers of cyberarts labs. In addition to parsing feminist interventions into cyberculture—including postcolonial critiques of virtuality and biotech, the material life of the internet and questions of reproduction and labor—the panel will also reflect on historical returns to and reconstructions of these contexts today. Speakers include Irina Aristarkhova, Maria Fernández, Mindy Seu, and Margaret Tan.",

    "excerpt": "MsGlitch403 is a collective initiated by four UCSC SIP interns in the summer of 2023, exploring the relationship between gender, sexuality, and representation in cyberspace. MsGlitch403 represents a multitude of ideas: Starting at its core, we take inspiration from ‘glitch,’ first coined inGlitch Feminism(574)by Legacy Russell, representing our divergence from the heteronormative digital sphere. Repurposing the ‘403’ from ‘403 Forbidden Error,’ a status code indicating the server understands the request but refuses to authorize it, we seek empowerment from becoming internet reformers who defy online restrictions. Lastly, by adopting ‘Ms,’ a title that emerged from the second-wave feminist movement, connoting women’s independence, we aim to create a feminine cyber persona applicable to anyone willing to transcend beyond the limitations of their physical bodies into the web.",
